	abstract = {Fluxes of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) through the oxygen deficient waters in the eastern tropical North Pacific were found to be relatively less attenuated with depth than elsewhere in the eastern North Pacific. The attenuation coefficient (b) for the flux was found to be 0.40 versus the composite value of 0.86 determined by Martin et al. (1987). To examine this further, sinking {POC} was collected using sediment traps and allowed to degrade in oxic and suboxic experiments. Using a kinetic model, it was found that degradation proceeded at similar rates (roughly 0.8 day−1) under oxic and suboxic conditions, but a greater fraction of bulk {POC} was resistant to degradation in the suboxic experiments (61\% vs. 23\%). Amino acids accounted for 37\% of {POC} collected at 75m, but following degradation the value dropped to 17\% and 16\% in the oxic and suboxic experiments respectively. {POC} collected from 500m was 10\% amino acids. The non-{AA} component of {POC} collected at 75m was not degraded under suboxic conditions, while under oxic conditions it was. These results suggest that microbes degrading {OC} under suboxic conditions via denitrification preferentially utilize nitrogen-rich amino acids. This preferential degradation of amino acids suggests that 9\% more nitrogen may be lost via water column denitrification than is accounted for when a more “Redfieldian” stoichiometry for {POC} is assumed.},

	abstract = {The eastern tropical North Pacific ({ETNP}) is a large region of anoxic water that hosts widespread water column N loss (denitrification). There is some disagreement about the long-term trends of denitrification and anoxia and long-term studies of water column denitrification within the anoxic zone are lacking. In this study, we compared {ETNP} water column nitrite, N*, and O2 data along the same transect for four studies ranging from 1972 to 2012. Anoxic water volume increased, and low-oxygen conditions expanded into shallower isopycnals from 1972 to 2012. A geochemical marker for cumulative N loss indicates that denitrification was highest in 2012 and the upper oxygen-deficient zone ({ODZ}) experienced the most change. Oxygen and N loss changes in the world's largest {ODZ} for 2012 could not be explained by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and decreased O2 in supply currents and increased wind-driven upwelling are likely mechanisms contributing to increased N loss and anoxia.},

	abstract = {A fraction of organic carbon produced in the oceans by phytoplankton sinks storing 5–15 gigatonnes of carbon annually in the ocean interior. The accepted paradigm is that rapid aggregation of phytoplankton cells occurs, forming large, fresh particles which sink quickly; this concept is incorporated into ecosystem models used to predict the future climate. Here we demonstrate a slower, less efficient export pathway in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Lipid biomarkers suggest that the large, fast-sinking particles found beneath the mixed layer are compositionally distinct from those found in the mixed layer and thus not directly and efficiently formed from phytoplankton cells. We postulate that they are formed from the in situ aggregation of smaller, slow-sinking particles over time in the mixed layer itself. This export pathway is likely widespread where smaller phytoplankton species dominate. Its lack of representation in biogeochemical models suggests that they may be currently overestimating the ability of the oceans to store carbon if large, fast-sinking, labile particles dominate simulated particle export.},

	abstract = {Oceanic oxygen deficient zones ({ODZs}) influence global biogeochemical cycles in a variety of ways, most notably by acting as a sink for fixed nitrogen (Codispoti et al. 2001). Optimum multiparameter analysis of data from two cruises in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific ({ETNP}) was implemented to develop a water mass analysis for the large {ODZ} in this region. This analysis reveals that the most pronounced oxygen deficient conditions are within the 13°C water (13CW) mass, which is distributed via subsurface mesoscale features such as eddies branching from the California Undercurrent. Nitrite accumulates within these eddies and slightly below the core of the 13CW. This water mass analysis also reveals that the 13CW and deeper Northern Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water ({NEPIW}) act as the two Pacific Equatorial source waters to the California Current System. The Equatorial Subsurface Water and Subtropical Subsurface Water are synonymous with the 13CW and this study refers to this water mass as the 13CW based on its history. Since the 13CW has been found to dominate the most pronounced oxygen deficient conditions within the Eastern Tropical South Pacific {ODZ} and the Peru-Chile Undercurrent, the 13CW and the {NEPIW} define boundaries for oxygen minimum conditions across the entire eastern Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Oxygen deficient zones ({ODZs}) in the tropical ocean exert a profound influence on global biogeochemical cycles, but the factors that regulate their long-term structure and sensitivity to oceanic change remain poorly understood. We analyzed hydrographic observations and a high-resolution physical/biogeochemical model to diagnose the primary pathways that ventilate the tropical Pacific {ODZs}. Historical and recent autonomous observations reveal pronounced and widespread O2 peaks, termed secondary oxygen maxima ({SOMs}), within the depths of the broader O2 minimum layer, especially at the equatorward edge of both northern and southern {ODZs}. In the northern {ODZ}, Lagrangian particle tracking in an eddy-permitting numerical model simulation attributes these features to intrusions of the Northern Subsurface Countercurrent along the equatorial edge of the {ODZ}. Zonal subsurface jets also ventilate the poleward edge of the northern {ODZ} but induce a smaller O2 flux and do not yield detectable {SOMs}. Along the {ODZ}'s eastern boundary, oxygenation is achieved by the seasonal cycle of upwelling of low-O2 water onto the continental shelf, followed by downwelling of O2-replenished near-surface waters back into the {ODZ}. Waters entering the northern Pacific {ODZ} originate from the extratropics in both hemispheres, but two thirds are from the Southern Hemisphere and arrive later and with a wider range of transit times. These results suggest that predicting future changes in the large Pacific {ODZs} will require a better understanding of the climate sensitivity of the narrow zonal jets and seasonal dynamics of coastal upwelling that supply their O2.},
