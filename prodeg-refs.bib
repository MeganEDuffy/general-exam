	abstract = {We examined metaproteome profiles from two Arctic microbiomes during 10-day shipboard incubations to directly track early functional and taxonomic responses to a simulated algal bloom and an oligotrophic control. Using a novel peptide-based enrichment analysis, significant changes (p-value {\textless} 0.01) in biological and molecular functions associated with carbon and nitrogen recycling were observed. Within the first day under both organic matter conditions, Bering Strait surface microbiomes increased protein synthesis, carbohydrate degradation, and cellular redox processes while decreasing C1 metabolism. Taxonomic assignments revealed that the core microbiome collectively responded to algal substrates by assimilating carbon before select taxa utilize and metabolize nitrogen intracellularly. Incubations of Chukchi Sea bottom water microbiomes showed similar, but delayed functional responses to identical treatments. Although 24 functional terms were shared between experimental treatments, the timing, and degree of the remaining responses were highly variable, showing that organic matter perturbation directs community functionality prior to alterations to the taxonomic distribution at the microbiome class level. The dynamic responses of these two oceanic microbial communities have important implications for timing and magnitude of responses to organic perturbations within the Arctic Ocean and how community-level functions may forecast biogeochemical gradients in oceans.},

	abstract = {Proteins represent the most abundant class of biomolecules in marine sinking particles and microbial biomass, yet their cycling in marine sediments is not fully understood. To investigate whether some portion of hydrolyzed proteins escapes complete remineralization and accumulate in the pore waters, we analyzed dissolved organic matter from the anoxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin, California, by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry ({FTICR}-{MS}). The results showed an increase in the molecular diversity and abundance of dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}) formulas with depth. A comparison of the detected {DON} formulas to a database of small peptides (2–4 amino acid sequences) returned 119 matches, and these formulas were most abundant near the sediment surface. When we compared our detected formulas to all possible structures that would result from deamination of peptides in the database, we found 680 formula matches. However, these molecular formulas can represent hundreds of different structural isomers (in the present case as many as 3257 different deaminated peptide structures), which cannot be distinguished by the {FTICR}-{MS} settings that were used. Analysis of amino acid sequences suggests that these deaminated peptides may be the products of selective degradation of source proteins in marine sediments. We hypothesize that these deaminated peptides accumulate in the pore waters due to extracellular proteinases being inhibited from completely hydrolyzing specific peptides to free amino acids. We suggest that anaerobic microbes deaminate peptides largely to produce H2, which is ultimately used as a reducing agent by other sediment microbes (e.g. {CO}2 reduction by methanogens). Simple calculations suggest that deaminated peptides may represent ∼25–45\% of {DOC} accumulating in these sediment pore waters. Unlike rapid remineralization of free amino acids, peptide deamination leaves behind the peptide carbon skeleton. Molecular structures of these remnant carbon skeletons may hold important clues about specific microbial processes influencing organic matter remineralization and accumulation.},

	abstract = {We drew upon recent advances in tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses in order to examine the proteins that remain after a diatom bloom enters the stationary phase, precipitates out of the photic zone, and is subjected to microbial degradation over a 23-d period within a controlled laboratory environment. Proteins were identified from tandem mass spectra searched against three different protein databases in order to track proteins from Thalassiosira pseudonana and any potential bacterial contributions. A rapid loss of diatom protein was observed over the incubation period; 75\% of the proteins initially identified were not detected after 72 h of exposure to a microbial population. By the 23rd day, peptides identified with high confidence correlated with only four T. pseudonana proteins. Five factors may have influenced the preservation of diatom proteins: (1) protection within organelles or structures with multiple membranes, (2) the relative cellular abundance in the photosynthetic apparatus, (3) the number of transmembrane domains in the protein sequence, (4) the presence of glycan modification motifs, and (5) the capability of proteins or peptides to aggregate into supramolecules.},
