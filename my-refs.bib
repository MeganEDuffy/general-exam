	abstract = {Copper-transporting {ATPase} {ATP}7A is essential for mammalian copper homeostasis. Loss of {ATP}7A activity is associated with fatal Menkes disease ({MD}) and various other pathologies. In cells, {ATP}7A inactivation disrupts copper transport from cytosol into the secretory pathway. Using fibroblasts from {MD} patients and mouse 3T3-L1 cells with a {CRISPR}/Cas9 inactivated {ATP}7A, we demonstrate that {ATP}7A dysfunction is also damaging to mitochondrial redox balance. In these cells, copper accumulates in nuclei, cytosol, and mitochondria, causing distinct changes in their redox environment. Quantitative imaging of live cells using {GRX}1-{roGFP}2 and {HyPer} sensors reveals highest glutathione oxidation and elevation of H2O2 in mitochondria, whereas the redox environment of nuclei and cytosol is much less affected. Decreasing the H2O2 levels in mitochondria with {MitoQ} does not prevent glutathione oxidation, i.e. elevated copper, and not H2O2 is a primary cause of glutathione oxidation. Redox misbalance does not significantly affect mitochondria morphology or activity of respiratory complex {IV} but markedly increases cell sensitivity to even mild glutathione depletion, resulting in loss of cell viability. Thus, {ATP}7A activity protects mitochondria from excessive copper entry, which is deleterious to redox buffers. Mitochondrial redox mis-balance could significantly contribute to pathologies associated with {ATP}7A inactivation in tissues with paradoxical accumulation of copper (i.e. renal epithelia).},

	abstract = {The anterior pituitary is specialized for the synthesis, storage and release of peptide hormones. The activation of inactive peptide hormone precursors requires a specific set of proteases and other post-translational processing enzymes. High levels of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase ({PAM}), an essential peptide processing enzyme, occur in the anterior pituitary. {PAM}, which converts glycine-extended peptides into amidated products, requires copper and zinc to support its two catalytic activities and calcium for structure. We used X-ray fluorescence microscopy on rat pituitary sections and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on subcellular fractions prepared from rat anterior pituitary to localize and quantify copper, zinc and calcium. X-ray fluorescence microscopy indicated that the calcium concentration in pituitary tissue was about 2.5 {mM}, 10-times more than zinc and 50-times more than copper. Although no higher than cytosolic levels, secretory granule levels of copper exceeded {PAM} levels by a factor of 10. Atp7a, which transports copper into the lumen of the secretory pathway, was enriched in endosomes and Golgi, not in secretory granules. If Atp7a transfers copper directly to {PAM}, this {pH}-dependent process is likely to occur in Golgi and endosomes.},

	abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}) prevalence is increasing worldwide, with the affected {US} population estimated near 30\%. Diet is a recognized risk factor in the {NAFLD} spectrum, which includes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}) and fibrosis. Low hepatic copper (Cu) was recently linked to clinical {NAFLD}/{NASH} severity. Simple sugar consumption including sucrose and fructose is implicated in {NAFLD}, while consumption of these macronutrients also decreases liver Cu levels. Though dietary sugar and low Cu are implicated in {NAFLD}, transcript-level responses that connect diet and pathology are not established. We have developed a mature rat model of {NAFLD} induced by dietary Cu deficiency, human-relevant high sucrose intake (30\% w/w) or both factors in combination. Compared to the control diet with adequate Cu and 10\% (w/w) sucrose, rats fed either high-sucrose or low-Cu diet had increased hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrogenesis, including hepatic stellate cell activation, while the combination of diet factors also increased {ATP} citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase gene transcription (fold change {\textgreater} 2, P {\textless} 0.02). Low dietary Cu decreased hepatic and serum Cu (P ≤ 0.05), promoted lipid peroxidation and induced {NAFLD}-like histopathology, while the combined factors also induced fasting hepatic insulin resistance and liver damage. Neither low Cu nor 30\% sucrose in the diet led to enhanced weight gain. Taken together, transcript profiles, histological and biochemical data indicate that low Cu and high sucrose promote hepatic gene expression and physiological responses associated with {NAFLD} and {NASH}, even in the absence of obesity or severe steatosis.},

	abstract = {The adaptor protein-1 complex ({AP}-1), which transports cargo between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, plays a role in the trafficking of Atp7a, a copper-transporting P-type {ATPase}, and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase ({PAM}), a copper-dependent membrane enzyme. Lack of any of the four {AP}-1 subunits impairs function, and patients with {MEDNIK} syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by lack of expression of the σ1A subunit, exhibit clinical and biochemical signs of impaired copper homeostasis. To explore the role of {AP}-1 in copper homeostasis in neuroendocrine cells, we used corticotrope tumor cells in which {AP}-1 function was diminished by reducing expression of its μ1A subunit. Copper levels were unchanged when {AP}-1 function was impaired, but cellular levels of Atp7a declined slightly. The ability of {PAM} to function was assessed by monitoring 18-{kDa} fragment-{NH}2 production from proopiomelanocortin. Reduced {AP}-1 function made 18-{kDa} fragment amidation more sensitive to inhibition by bathocuproine disulfonate, a cell-impermeant Cu(I) chelator. The endocytic trafficking of {PAM} was altered, and {PAM}-1 accumulated on the cell surface when {AP}-1 levels were reduced. Reduced {AP}-1 function increased the Atp7a presence in early/recycling endosomes but did not alter the ability of copper to stimulate its appearance on the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation of a small fraction of {PAM} and Atp7a supports the suggestion that copper can be transferred directly from Atp7a to {PAM}, a process that can occur only when both proteins are present in the same subcellular compartment. Altered luminal cuproenzyme function may contribute to deficits observed when the {AP}-1 function is compromised.},

	abstract = {Ocean metaproteomics is an emerging field enabling discoveries about marine microbial communities and their impact on global biogeochemical processes. Recent ocean metaproteomic studies have provided insight into microbial nutrient transport, colimitation of carbon fixation, the metabolism of microbial biofilms, and dynamics of carbon flux in marine ecosystems. Future methodological developments could provide new capabilities such as characterizing long-term ecosystem changes, biogeochemical reaction rates, and in situ stoichiometries. Yet challenges remain for ocean metaproteomics due to the great biological diversity that produces highly complex mass spectra, as well as the difficulty in obtaining and working with environmental samples. This review summarizes the progress and challenges facing ocean metaproteomic scientists and proposes best practices for data sharing of ocean metaproteomic data sets, including the data types and metadata needed to enable intercomparisons of protein distributions and annotations that could foster global ocean metaproteomic capabilities.},

Here we investigate the offshore Eastern Tropical North Pacific ({ETNP}) where a secondary chlorophyll a maximum resides within the {ODZ}. Rates of primary production and carbon export from the mixed layer and productivity in the primary chlorophyll a maximum were consistent with oligotrophic waters. However, sediment trap carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased between 105 and 150 m, indicating organic matter production within the {ODZ}. Metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization indicated that the secondary chlorophyll a maximum was attributable to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, and numerous photosynthesis and carbon fixation proteins were detected. The presence of chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospina and detection of nitrate oxidoreductase was consistent with cyanobacterial oxygen production within the {ODZ}. Cyanobacteria and cyanophage were also present on large ({\textgreater}30 μm) particles and in sediment trap material. Particle cyanophage-to-host ratio exceeded 50, suggesting that viruses help convert cyanobacteria into sinking organic matter. Nitrate reduction and anammox proteins were detected, congruent with previously reported N2 production. We suggest that autochthonous organic matter production within the {ODZ} contributes to N2 production in the offshore {ETNP}.},
