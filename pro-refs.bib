	abstract = {Prochlorococcus {MED}4 has, with a total of only 1,716 annotated protein-coding genes, the most compact genome of a free-living photoautotroph. Although light quality and quantity play an important role in regulating the growth rate of this organism in its natural habitat, the majority of known light-sensing proteins are absent from its genome. To explore the potential for light sensing in this phototroph, we measured its global gene expression pattern in response to different light qualities and quantities by using high-density Affymetrix microarrays. Though seven different conditions were tested, only blue light elicited a strong response. In addition, hierarchical clustering revealed that the responses to high white light and blue light were very similar and different from that of the lower-intensity white light, suggesting that the actual sensing of high light is mediated via a blue-light receptor. Bacterial cryptochromes seem to be good candidates for the blue-light sensors. The existence of a signaling pathway for the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was suggested by the presence of genes that responded similarly to red and blue light as well as genes that responded to the addition of {DCMU} [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-N-N′-dimethylurea], a specific inhibitor of photosystem {II}-mediated electron transport.},

	abstract = {Background
Gene gain and loss frequently occurs in the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, a phototroph that numerically dominates tropical and subtropical open oceans. However, little is known about the stabilization of its core genome, which contains approximately 1250 genes, in the context of genome streamlining. Using Prochlorococcus {MED}4 as a model organism, we investigated the constraints on core genome stabilization using transcriptome profiling.

Results
{RNA}-Seq technique was used to obtain the transcriptome map of Prochlorococcus {MED}4, including operons, untranslated regions, non-coding {RNAs}, and novel genes. Genome-wide expression profiles revealed that three factors contribute to core genome stabilization. First, a negative correlation between gene expression levels and protein evolutionary rates was observed. Highly expressed genes were overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome. Gene necessity was determined as a second powerful constraint on genome evolution through functional enrichment analysis. Third, quick {mRNA} turnover may increase corresponding proteins’ fidelity among genes that were abundantly expressed. Together, these factors influence core genome stabilization during {MED}4 genome evolution.

Conclusions
Gene expression, gene necessity, and {mRNA} turnover contribute to core genome maintenance during cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus genus evolution.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of photosynthetic picoplankton has changed our understanding of marine food webs1. Both prokaryotic2,3 and eukaryotic4,5 species occur in most of the world's oceans and account for a significant proportion of global productivity6. Using shipboard flow cytometry, we have identified a new group of picoplankters which are extremely abundant, and barely visible using traditional microscopic techniques. These cells are smaller than the coccoid cyanobacteria and reach concentrations greater than 105 cells ml–1 in the deep euphotic zone. They fluoresce red and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment, as well as chlorophyll b, α-carotene, and zeaxanthin. This unusual combination of pigments, and a distinctive prokaryotic ultrastructure, suggests that these picoplankters are free-living relatives of Prochloron7. They differ from previously reported prochlorophytes—the putative ancestors of the chloroplasts of higher plants—in that they contain α-carotene rather than β-carotene and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment as the dominant chlorophyll.},
