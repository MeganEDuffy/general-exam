Metaproteomics offers the ability to resolve the major catalytic units of microbial populations and thereby allows the establishment of genotype-phenotype linkages from in situ samples. A decade has passed since the term "metaproteomics" was first coined and corresponding analyses were carried out on mixed microbial communities. Since then metaproteomics has yielded many important insights into microbial ecosystem function in the various environmental settings where it has been applied. Although initial progress in analytical capacities and resulting numbers of proteins identified was extremely fast, this trend slowed rapidly. Here, we discuss several representative metaproteomic investigations of activated sludge, acid mine drainage biofilms, freshwater and seawater microbial communities, soil, and human gut microbiota. By using these case studies, we highlight current challenges and possible solutions for metaproteomics to realize its full potential, i.e. to enable conclusive links between microbial community composition, physiology, function, interactions, ecology, and evolution in situ.},

	abstract = {Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry ({AP}-{MS}) is now a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (e.g. proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. While the standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative controls, most small-scale {AP}-{MS} studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait-independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple {AP}-{MS} studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (the {CRAPome}) and describe the use of this resource to score protein-protein interactions.

	abstract = {Archaea are widely distributed and yet are most often not the most abundant members of microbial communities. Here, we document a transition from Bacteria- to Archaea-dominated communities in microbial biofilms sampled from the Richmond Mine acid mine drainage ({AMD}) system (∼{pH} 1.0, ∼38°C) and in laboratory-cultivated biofilms. This transition occurs when chemoautotrophic microbial communities that develop at the air-solution interface sink to the sediment-solution interface and degrade under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The archaea identified in these sunken biofilms are from the class Thermoplasmata, and in some cases, the highly divergent {ARMAN} nanoarchaeal lineage. In several of the sunken biofilms, nanoarchaea comprise 10 to 25\% of the community, based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and metagenomic analyses. Comparative community proteomic analyses show a persistence of bacterial proteins in sunken biofilms, but there is clear evidence for amino acid modifications due to acid hydrolysis. Given the low representation of bacterial cells in sunken biofilms based on microscopy, we infer that hydrolysis reflects proteins derived from lysed cells. For archaea, we detected ∼2,400 distinct proteins, including a subset involved in proteolysis and peptide uptake. Laboratory cultivation experiments using complex carbon substrates demonstrated anaerobic enrichment of Ferroplasma and Aplasma coupled to the reduction of ferric iron. These findings indicate dominance of acidophilic archaea in degrading biofilms and suggest that they play roles in anaerobic nutrient cycling at low {pH}.},

	abstract = {Intact proteins comprise a major component of organic carbon and nitrogen produced globally and are likely an important fraction of organic matter in sediments and soils. Extracting the protein component from sediments and soils for mass spectral characterization and identification represents a substantial challenge given the range of products and functionalities present in the complex matrix. Multiple forms of gel electrophoresis were evaluated as a means of enhancing recovery of sedimentary protein before proteomic characterization and compared with a direct enzymatic digestion of proteins in sediments. Resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed using shotgun proteomics and tandem mass spectra were evaluated with {SEQUEST}. Multiple databases were then evaluated to examine the ability to confidently identify proteins from environmental samples. Following evaluation of electrophoretic extraction of proteins from sediments, the recovery of an experimentally added standard protein ({BSA}) from older ({\textgreater}1 ky) sediments was optimized. Protein extraction from sediments via direct electrophoresis of a slurry mixture and the specified extraction buffer resulted in the greatest number of confident protein identifications and highest sequence coverage of the {BSA} standard. Searching tandem mass spectral data against larger databases with a higher diversity of proteomes did not yield a greater number of, or more confidence in, protein identifications. Regardless of the protein database used, identified peptides correlated to proteins with the same function across taxa. This suggests that while determining taxonomic-level information remains a challenge in samples with unknown mixed species, it is possible to confidently assign the function of the identified protein.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.3389/fmicb.2017.00057},
	abstract = {Despite their potential importance as analogs of primitive microbial metabolisms, the knowledge of the structure and functioning of the deep ecosystems associated with serpentinizing environments is hampered by the lack of accessibility to relevant systems. These hyperalkaline environments are depleted in dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), making the carbon sources and assimilation pathways in the associated ecosystems highly enigmatic. The Prony Bay Hydrothermal Field ({PHF}) is an active serpentinization site where, similar to Lost City (Mid-Atlantic Ridge), high-{pH} fluids rich in H2 and {CH}4 are discharged from carbonate chimneys at the seafloor, but in a shallower lagoonal environment. This study aimed to characterize the subsurface microbial ecology of this environment by focusing on the earliest stages of chimney construction, dominated by the discharge of hydrothermal fluids of subseafloor origin. By jointly examining the mineralogy and the microbial diversity of the conduits of juvenile edifices at the micrometric scale, we find a central role of uncultivated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes in the ecology of the {PHF}. These bacteria, along with members of the phyla Acetothermia and Omnitrophica, are identified as the first chimneys inhabitants before archaeal Methanosarcinales. They are involved in the construction and early consolidation of the carbonate structures via organomineralization processes. Their predominance in the most juvenile and nascent hydrothermal chimneys, and their affiliation with environmental subsurface microorganisms, indicate that they are likely discharged with hydrothermal fluids from the subseafloor. They may thus be representative of endolithic serpentinization-based ecosystems, in an environment where {DIC} is limited. In contrast, heterotrophic and fermentative microorganisms may consume organic compounds from the abiotic by-products of serpentinization processes and/or from life in the deeper subsurface. We thus propose that the Firmicutes identified at {PHF} may have a versatile metabolism with the capability to use diverse organic compounds from biological or abiotic origin. From that perspective, this study sheds new light on the structure of deep microbial communities living at the energetic edge in serpentinites and may provide an alternative model of the earliest metabolisms.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic marine bacterioplankton are a critical component of the carbon cycle, processing nearly a quarter of annual primary production, yet defining how substrate utilization preferences and resource partitioning structure microbial communities remains a challenge. In this study, proteomic stable isotope probing (proteomic {SIP}) was used to characterize population-specific assimilation of dissolved free amino acids ({DFAAs}), a major source of dissolved organic carbon for bacterial secondary production in aquatic environments. Microcosms of seawater collected from Newport, Oregon, and Monterey Bay, California, were incubated with 1 µM 13C-labeled amino acids for 15 and 32 h. The taxonomic compositions of microcosm metaproteomes were highly similar to those of the sampled natural communities, with Rhodobacteriales, {SAR}11, and Flavobacteriales representing the dominant taxa. Analysis of 13C incorporation into protein biomass allowed for quantification of the isotopic enrichment of identified proteins and subsequent determination of differential amino acid assimilation patterns between specific bacterioplankton populations. Proteins associated with Rhodobacterales tended to have a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, opposite the trend for Flavobacteriales and {SAR}11 proteins. Rhodobacterales proteins associated with amino acid transport and metabolism had an increased frequency of 13C-enriched spectra at time point 2. Alteromonadales proteins also had a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, particularly within ribosomal proteins, demonstrating their rapid growth during incubations. Overall, proteomic {SIP} facilitated quantitative comparisons of {DFAA} assimilation by specific taxa, both between sympatric populations and between protein functional groups within discrete populations, allowing an unprecedented examination of population level metabolic responses to resource acquisition in complex microbial communities.
{IMPORTANCE} An estimated 50 gigatons of carbon is annually fixed within marine systems, of which heterotrophic microbial populations process nearly half. These communities vary in composition and activity across spatial and temporal scales, so understanding how these changes affect global processes requires the delineation of functional roles for individual members. In a step toward ascertaining these roles, we applied proteomic stable isotope probing to quantify the assimilation of organic carbon from {DFAAs} into microbial protein biomass, since the turnover of {DFAAs} accounts for a substantial fraction of marine microbial carbon metabolism that is directed into biomass production. We conducted experiments at two coastal North Pacific locations and found taxonomically distinct responses. This approach allowed us to compare amino acid assimilation by specific bacterioplankton populations and characterize their allocation of this substrate among cellular functions.},

	abstract = {We report here a systematic evaluation of a multiplex mass spectrometry method coupled with ion mobility separation ({HD}-{MSE}) for the identification and quantification of proteins in the chloroplast stroma. We show that this method allows the robust quantification of reference proteins in mixtures, and it detects concentration differences with high sensitivity when three replicas are performed. Applied to the analysis of the chloroplast stroma proteome, {HD}-{MSE} identified and quantified many chloroplast proteins that were not previously identified in large-scale proteome analyses, suggesting {HD}-{MSE} as a suitable complementary tool for discovery proteomics. We find that {HD}-{MSE} tends to underestimate protein abundances at concentrations above 25 fmol, which is likely due to ion transmission loss and detector saturation. This limitation can be circumvented by omitting the ion mobility separation step in the {HD}-{MSE} workflow. The robustness of protein quantification is influenced by the selection of peptides and their intensity distribution, therefore critical scrutiny of quantification results is required. Based on the {HD}-{MSE} quantification of chloroplast stroma proteins we performed a meta-analysis and compared published quantitative data with our results, using a parts per million normalization scheme. Important pathways in the chloroplast stroma show quantitative stability against different experimental conditions and quantification strategies.
Biological significance
Our analysis establishes {MSE}-based Hi3 quantification as a tool for the absolute quantification of proteins in the chloroplast stroma. The meta-analysis performed with a parts per million normalization scheme shows that quantitative proteomics data acquired in different labs and with different quantification strategies yield comparable results for some metabolic pathways, while others show a higher variability. Our data therefore indicate that such meta-analyses allow distinguishing robust from fine-controlled metabolic pathways.},

De novo methods utilize computational approaches to deduce the sequence or partial sequence of peptides directly from the experimental {MS}/{MS} spectra. The concepts behind a number of de novo sequencing methods are discussed. The other approach to identify peptides by tandem mass spectrometry is to match the fragment ions with virtual peptide ions generated from a genomic or protein database. De novo methods are essential to identify proteins when the genomes are not known but they are also extremely useful even when the genomes are known since they are not affected by errors in a search database. Another advantage of de novo methods is that the partial sequence can be used to search for posttranslation modifications or for the identification of mutations by homology based software.},

The Bering Sea is a highly productive system dominated by seasonal blooms and was used as a model system for algal proteins to be tracked through the water column and incorporated into detrital sedimentary material. Samples of suspended and sinking particles were collected at multiple depths along with surface sediments on the continental shelf and deeper basin of the Bering Sea. Modified standard proteomic preparations were used in conjunction with high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify the suite of proteins present and monitor changes in their distribution. In surface waters 207 proteins were identified, decreasing through the water column to 52 proteins identified in post-bloom shelf surface sediments and 24 proteins in deeper (3490 m) basin sediments. The vast majority of identified proteins in all samples were diatom in origin, reflecting their dominant contribution of biomass during the spring bloom. Identified proteins were predominantly from metabolic, binding/structural, and transport-related protein groups. Significant linear correlations were observed between the number of proteins identified and the concentration of total hydrolysable amino acids normalized to carbon and nitrogen. Organelle-bound, transmembrane, photosynthetic, and other proteins involved in light harvesting were preferentially retained during recycling. These findings suggest that organelle and membrane protection represent important mechanisms that enhance the preservation of protein during transport and incorporation into sediments.},

	abstract = {Metaproteomics characterizes proteins expressed by microorganism communities (microbiome) present in environmental samples or a host organism (e.g. human), revealing insights into the molecular functions conferred by these communities. Compared to conventional proteomics, metaproteomics presents unique data analysis challenges, including the use of large protein databases derived from hundreds or thousands of organisms, as well as numerous processing steps to ensure high data quality. These challenges limit the use of metaproteomics for many researchers. In response, we have developed an accessible and flexible metaproteomics workflow within the Galaxy bioinformatics framework. Via analysis of human oral tissue exudate samples, we have established a modular Galaxy-based workflow that automates a reduction method for searching large sequence databases, enabling comprehensive identification of host proteins (human) as well as "meta-proteins" from the nonhost organisms. Downstream, automated processing steps enable basic local alignment search tool analysis and evaluation/visualization of peptide sequence match quality, maximizing confidence in results. Outputted results are compatible with tools for taxonomic and functional characterization (e.g. Unipept, {MEGAN}5). Galaxy also allows for the sharing of complete workflows with others, promoting reproducibility and also providing a template for further modification and enhancement. Our results provide a blueprint for establishing Galaxy as a solution for metaproteomic data analysis.

Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods.

	abstract = {Motivation: One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.
Results: We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the {ROC} curve from 76\% to 87\%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.

The integration of ion mobility separation ({IMS}) into {DIA} workflows provides an additional dimension of separation to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}), and it increases the achievable analytical depth of {DIA} approaches. Here we provide a detailed protocol for a label-free quantitative proteomics workflow based on ion mobility–enhanced {DIA}, which synchronizes precursor ion drift times with collision energies to improve precursor fragmentation efficiency. The protocol comprises a detailed description of all major steps including instrument setup, filter-aided sample preparation, {LC}-{IMS}-{MS} analysis and data processing. Our protocol can handle proteome samples of any complexity, and it enables a highly reproducible and accurate precursor intensity–based label-free quantification of up to 5,600 proteins across multiple runs in complete cellular lysates. Depending on the number of samples to be analyzed, the protocol takes a minimum of 3 d to complete from proteolytic digestion to data evaluation.},

In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, {PEAKS}, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. {PEAKS} uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the {MS}/{MS} spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of {PEAKS} is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-{TOF}) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.},

How these microorganisms do this work at the level of the expressed protein is known only from a few studies of targeted lineages. We used comparative membrane metaproteomics to identify functional responses of communities to different nutrient concentrations on an oceanic scale. Comparative analyses of microbial membrane fractions revealed shifts in nutrient utilization and energy transduction along an environmental gradient in South Atlantic surface waters, from a low-nutrient gyre to a highly productive coastal upwelling region. The dominant membrane proteins identified (19\%) were {TonB}-dependent transporters ({TBDTs}), which are known to utilize a proton motive force to transport nutrients across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The ocean-wide importance of {TonB}-dependent nutrient acquisition in marine bacteria was unsuspected. Diverse light-harvesting rhodopsins were detected in membrane proteomes from every sample. Proteomic evidence of both {TBDTs} and rhodopsins in the same lineages suggest that phototrophic bacterioplankton have the potential to use energy from light to fuel transport activities. We also identified viral proteins in every sample and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase proteins in the upwelling region, suggesting that Archaea are important nitrifiers in nutrient-rich surface waters.},

Patients exhibited significant higher levels of S100A9 and S100A8 proteoforms, and their oxidized forms with respect to controls. Oxidation occurred on methionine and tryptophan residues, and on the unique cysteine residue, in position 42 in S100A8, and 3 in S100A9, that generated glutathionylated, cysteinylated, sulfinic, sulfonic, and disulfide dimeric forms. Wilson's disease patient saliva showed high levels of two new fragments of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and of α-defensins 2 and 4. Overall, the salivary proteome of Wilson's disease patients reflected oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions characteristic of the pathology, highlighting differences that could be useful clues of disease exacerbation.},

We addressed this challenge with a targeted metaproteomics workflow for {NtcA} and P-{II}, two nitrogen regulatory proteins, and demonstrated its application for cyanobacterial taxa within microbial samples from the Central Pacific Ocean. Using {METATRYP}, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less. The related cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus shared an average of 4.8 ± 1.9\% of their tryptic peptides, while shared intraspecies peptides were higher, 13 ± 15\% shared peptides between 12 Prochlorococcus genomes. An {NtcA} peptide was found to target multiple cyanobacteria species, whereas a P-{II} peptide showed specificity to the high-light Prochlorococcus ecotype. Distributions of {NtcA} and P-{II} in the Central Pacific Ocean were similar except at the Equator likely due to differential nitrogen stress responses between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The number of unique tryptic peptides coded for within three combined oceanic microbial metagenomes was estimated to be ∼4 × 10(7) , 1000-fold larger than an individual microbial proteome and 27-fold larger than the human proteome, yet still 20 orders of magnitude lower than the peptide diversity possible in all protein space, implying that peptide mapping algorithms should be able to withstand the added level of complexity in metaproteomic samples.},

Among the methods available for investigation of microbial communities, metaproteomics can approximate the activity of microorganisms by investigating the protein content of a sample. Although metaproteomics is a very powerful method, issues within the bioinformatic evaluation impede its success. In particular, construction of databases for protein identification, grouping of redundant proteins as well as taxonomic and functional annotation pose big challenges.

We also examine how the conclusions of a comparative analysis are influenced by the manner in which the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} data is ‘rolled up’ to the protein level, and show that divergent conclusions obtained using different rollups can be informative. Our analysis is based on two publicly available reference data sets, {BIATECH}-54 and {CPTAC}, which were developed for the purpose of assessing methods used in label-free differential proteomic studies.

The total {EEA} is the sum of cell-bound (i.e., cell-attached), and dissolved (i.e., cell-free) enzyme activities. Cell-free enzymes make up a substantial proportion (up to 100\%) of the total marine {EEA}. Although we are learning more about how microbial diversity and function (including total {EEA}) will be affected by environmental changes, little is known about what factors control the importance of the abundant cell-free enzymes. Since cell-attached {EEAs} are linked to the cell, their fate will likely be linked to the factors controlling the cell’s fate. In contrast, cell-free enzymes belong to a kind of “living dead” realm because they are not attached to a living cell but still are able to perform their function away from the cell; and as such, the factors controlling their activity and fate might differ from those affecting cell-attached enzymes. This article aims to place cell-free {EEA} into the wider context of hydrolysis of organic matter, deal with recent studies assessing what controls the production, activity and lifetime of cell-free {EEA}, and what their fate might be in response to environmental stressors. This perspective article advocates the need to go “beyond the living things”, studying the response of cells/organisms to different stressors, but also to study cell-free enzymes, in order to fully constrain the future and evolution of marine biogeochemical cycles.},

	abstract = {A number of different approaches have been described to identify proteins from tandem mass spectrometry ({MS}/{MS}) data. The most common approaches rely on the available databases to match experimental {MS}/{MS} data. These methods suffer from several drawbacks and cannot be used for the identification of proteins from unknown genomes. In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, {PEAKS}, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. {PEAKS} uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the {MS}/{MS} spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of {PEAKS} is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-{TOF}) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.

	abstract = {Background
The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, having multiple ecotypes of distinct genotypic/phenotypic traits and being the first documented example of genome shrinkage in free-living organisms, offers an ideal system for studying niche-driven molecular micro-diversity in closely related microbes. The present study, through an extensive comparative analysis of various genomic/proteomic features of 6 high light ({HL}) and 6 low light ({LL}) adapted strains, makes an attempt to identify molecular determinants associated with their vertical niche partitioning.

Results
Pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in synonymous codon usage is observed exclusively in {LL} strains. Distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by 2 {LL} strains with larger genomes and G+C-content ≈ 50\% (group {LLa}), 4 {LL} strains having reduced genomes and G+C-content ≈ 35-37\% (group {LLb}), and 6 {HL} strains. Taking into account the emergence of {LLa}, {LLb} and {HL} strains (based on 16S {rRNA} phylogeny), a gradual increase in average aromaticity, {pI} values and beta- \& coil-forming propensities and a decrease in mean hydrophobicity, instability indices and helix-forming propensities of core proteins are observed. Greater variations in orthologous gene repertoire are found between {LLa} and {LLb} strains, while higher number of positively selected genes exist between {LL} and {HL} strains.

Conclusion
Strains of different Prochlorococcus groups are characterized by distinct compositional, physicochemical and structural traits that are not mere remnants of a continuous genetic drift, but are potential outcomes of a grand scheme of niche-oriented stepwise diversification, that might have driven them chronologically towards greater stability/fidelity and invoked upon them a special ability to inhabit diverse oceanic environments.},

The median macromolecular composition of nutrient-sufficient exponentially growing microalgae is 32.2\% protein, 17.3\% lipid, 15.0\% carbohydrate, 17.3\% ash, 5.7\% {RNA}, 1.1\% chlorophyll-a and 1.0\% {DNA} as percent dry weight. Our analysis identifies significant phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition undetected by previous studies due to small sample sizes and the large inherent variability in macromolecular pools. The phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition lead to variations in carbon-to-nitrogen ratios that are consistent with independent observations. These phylogenetic differences in macromolecular and elemental composition reflect adaptations in cellular architecture and biochemistry; specifically in the cell wall, the light harvesting apparatus, and storage pools.},

We estimate the cellular abundance of 92\% of the proteins in the yeast proteome and assess the variation in each abundance measurement.
