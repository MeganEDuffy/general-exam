	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: {PSORTb} has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular localization ({SCL}) predictor since it was first made available in 2003. However, the recall needs to be improved and no accurate {SCL} predictors yet make predictions for archaea, nor differentiate important localization subcategories, such as proteins targeted to a host cell or bacterial hyperstructures/organelles. Such improvements should preferably be encompassed in a freely available web-based predictor that can also be used as a standalone program.
{RESULTS}: We developed {PSORTb} version 3.0 with improved recall, higher proteome-scale prediction coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. It is the first {SCL} predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with atypical membrane/cell wall topologies. It features an improved standalone program, with a new batch results delivery system complementing its web interface. We evaluated the most accurate {SCL} predictors using 5-fold cross validation plus we performed an independent proteomics analysis, showing that {PSORTb} 3.0 is the most accurate but can benefit from being complemented by Proteome Analyst predictions.

A single undiagnosed species belonging to the genus Aulacoseira is abundant in this material and re-veals, in addition to the full complement of siliceous struc-tures comprising the frustule, an array of soft parts that hitherto have been unavailable for study in diatoms of this age. These features include the velar complex, which lines the interior of valves, layered internal membranes, lamel-late plastid fragments with pyrenoid-like inclusions, and extracellular mucilagenous bodies. Both ultrastructural and cytoplasmic characters have pronounced affinities with extant congeneric taxa, with an especially close resem-blance to the resting cells observed in living Aulacoseira. These observations suggest that modern cellular organiza-tion and associated ecological adaptations were present ear-ly in the history of nonmarine aulacoseiroid diatoms, im-plying that prolonged evolutionary stasis has characterized the ecologically important genus Aulacoseira.},

	abstract = {In a study of the transport and transformation of particulate amino acids in the Southern Ocean, we found that silicate and calcium carbonate biominerals play an important role in the preservation of amino acids throughout the water column and surface sediments. Plankton, sinking particle and sediment samples were collected during the {USJGOFS} {AESOPS} transect across the Antarctic Polar Front ({APF}) along 170°W. Total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) made up of 17–27\% of total organic carbon (Corg) in sinking particles and 6–23\% of Corg in surface sediments. In addition to {THAA}, we measured amino acids bound in silicate ({SiTHAA}) and calcium carbonate ({CaTHAA}) biominerals. Although the fraction of biomineral bound to total amino acids in plankton was small, {\textless}1\%, the ratio of mineral-bound to non-mineral-bound amino acids increased with depth in the water column and sediments. Mineral-bound amino acids often dominated the total amino acid pool in biomineral-rich sediments beneath the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. {SiTHAA} were enriched in glycine and threonine relative to {THAA} and were similar in composition to {SiTHAA} in diatom frustules isolated from {APF} sediments. {CaTHAA} were enriched in aspartic acid relative to {THAA}. The difference in composition between mineral-bound amino acids and non-mineral-bound amino acids increased with depth. Amino acid composition has been used to develop a Degradation Index (sensu Dauwe and Middelburg, 1998). The unusual amino acid composition of Southern Ocean plankton, i.e., dominated by diatom cell walls, resulted in an apparent mismatch between the absolute value of the Degradation Index and the presumed extent of degradation. However, changes in amino acid composition that accompanied degradation were similar to those found in previous studies. Principal components analysis suggests that the greatest change in {THAA} composition occurred between the sediment surface floc layer and deeper sediments where particles had the longest residence time. Compositional changes observed in the water column suggested that degradation processes resulted in complete removal of amino acids, whereas changes in sediments were consistent both with selective degradation of plankton amino acids with depth and with the conversion of primarily phytoplankton biomass to that of bacterial biomass.},

	abstract = {Relationships between mineral specific surface area and organic carbon ({OC}) concentration are examined for sediments and soil A-horizons from throughout the world. I found (published elsewhere) that continental shelf sediments from many different regions exhibit downcore loss of {OC} to a refractory background level which shows a consistent relationship with mineral surface area (slope = 0.86 mg m−2 {OC}). This trend is equivalent to a monolayer of organic matter over all surfaces, and is termed the monolayer-equivalent ({ME}) level. Sediments and soils from other environments are compared to this empirically derived relationship. Several continental slope areas show extension of this relationship to considerable depth. Marked excesses of {OC} above this trend, which persist downcore, were found in sediments with high carbonate mineral content or slope sediments with low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the overlying water column. About half of the soils examined also adhered to this relationship, while soils with high carbonate content, low {pH}, or poor drainage showed {OC} concentrations higher than the {ME} level. {OC} concentrations below the {ME} level are found in deltaic regions and areas with low organic matter delivery such as the deep sea or arid soils. The nature of mineral surfaces was examined using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and most surface area was found to be present as pores with {\textless} 8-nm widths. A hypothesis is developed that explains the observed {OC} concentrations as a saturation of adsorption sites within small pores, which are small enough to exclude hydrolytic enzymes and hence protect organic matter against biological attack. The relationship between this hypothesis and other hypothesized protection mechanisms is discussed. Adsorption is shown to provide a mechanistic and quantitative explanation for spatial and temporal relationships between sedimentation rate and {OC} burial.},

	abstract = {{ORGANIC} matter preserved in marine sediments provides a molecular record of marine biological processes1, accounts for approximately 20\% of all carbon burial2 and plays a key role in balancing the long-term flux of oxygen to the atmosphere3. Only recently has it been appreciated that more than 90\% of the organic matter preserved in most marine sediments is intimately associated with mineral surfaces4. Little is known, however, of the effect that sorption to mineral surfaces might have in controlling either the lability or quantity of organic matter in the marine sedimentary record. The preserved organic material could be either intrinsically stable, or stabilized through interactions with mineral matrices. We show here that sorption of organic matter to mineral surfaces in marine sediments stabilizes the component molecules, slowing remineralization rates by up to five orders of magnitude. Sorptive protection can therefore account for the enigmatic preservation of intrinsically labile molecules such as amino acids and simple sugars in marine deposits5,6 and links the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments to the deposition of mineral surfaces.},

	abstract = {Sediment cores from six stations in the eastern North Sea were analyzed for protein amino acids, the nonprotein amino acids β-alanine and γ- aminobutyric acid and the hexosamines galactosamine and glucosamine, and bulk parameters (organic carbon, nitrogen, total hydrolyzable amino acids and carbohydrates) in order to establish the degradation state of sedimentary organic matter. The study sites were selected on the basis of their different physical settings and macrofaunal communities so that a broad quality range in the organic matter would likely be covered. To test if the molecular parameters provide a robust matrix for quality determination, we integrated our results with complementary literature data ranging from marine source organisms to deep-sea environments. A principal component analysis based on the mole percent contribution of amino acids show4 that there are systematic variations in the amino acid spectra as a consequence of degradation of organic matter. Comparison with more established quality parameters such as hexosamines confirmed that amino acids reflect the degradation state of the organic matter. The amino acids glycine, serine, and threonine were enriched in the more degraded material, and others, such as phenylalanine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucinc, became depleted with increasing degradation state. Selective preservation of structural compounds (diatom cell walls, chitinous organic matter) vs. preferential breakdown of cell plasma material appears to be the reason for the contrastin,; behavior of these molecular compounds. Some of the essential amino acids for macrofauna nutrition (arginine, methionine, and histidine) occurred in lower concentrations in the North Sea sediments compared to organism tissue and therefore may be limiting to growth of deposit-feeders.},
