measured the abundance and biomass production of heterotrophic
bacterioplankton in the subarctic Pacific and compared these parameters
with those of phytoplankton during four cruises in 1987 and 1988.
Bacterial biomass was about equal to phytoplankton biomass during all
cruises. Based on rates of bacterial biomass production and assuming a
growth efficiency of 50\%, we estimate that heterotrophic bacteria
consumed 10\% (June 1987) to 24\% (August 1988) of primary production in
the euphotic zone. These percentages are low compared with other aquatic
ecosystems, apparently due to low bacterial growth rates ({\textless}0.1 day
-1) iin the subarctic Pacific. In contrast, phytoplankton
growth rates were much higher (0.1-8.8 day -1). Bacterial
growth rates were limited by the supply of dissolved organic matter and
temperature. Even with these low growth rates, however, bacterial
biomass and rates of biomass production increased by 2-5-fold in May and
August 1988, changes that were not obviously related to corresponding
changes in phytoplankton biomass nor primary production. Heterotrophic
bacterioplankton constitutes a large reservoir of carbon and nitrogen
that needs to be considered in modelling ecosystem dynamics of the
subarctic Pacific.},

The emphasis is on chemical studies but, in keeping with the growing interdisciplinary nature of marine science, advances in other disciplines are also discussed, particularly those in biological sciences. Increasing evidence for the importance of picoplankton, bacteria and viruses as {POM} constituents is highlighted, including the recent recognition of large populations of autotrophic bacteria able to harvest light for energy. The transport of {POM} to bottom waters was thought to be largely confined to large, rapidly sinking faecal pellets. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of organic aggregates and flocs formed by diatoms such as Rhizosolenia and other microalgae. Ascending particles have also been discovered, many of which are lipid-rich. Several studies have shown that resuspension of bottom sediments and lateral advection of material from continental shelves can lead to anomalously high particle fluxes measured in sediment traps moored in deep water. Many new approaches for characterizing {POM} have emerged, such as pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry for analysis of higher molecular weight materials and biopolymers. Lipid biomarker techniques have also advanced, exciting new possibilities being raised by the ability to measure stable and radioactive carbon isotopes for individual compounds. The techniques of molecular biology, such as the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), are being increasingly applied to provide complementary information to more conventional microscopy and flow cytometry on the identity of organisms in the sea. The combination of these techniques with advanced chemical analysis methods promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the origins, transport and fate of organic matter in the oceans.},

	abstract = {The sources and burial processes of organic matter in marine sediments are not well understood, yet they are important if we are to have a better understanding of the global carbon cycle. In particular, the nature and fraction of the terrestrial organic carbon preserved in marine sediments is poorly constrained. Here we use the chemical and stable carbon isotope signatures of oxidation products from a macromolecular component (lignin) of the terrigenous organic matter preserved in offshore surface sediments in the Gulf of Mexico to complement similar data from an existing onshore transect in this region. The complete onshore–offshore data set, along with radiocarbon dates of the bulk organic material at the same sites, allows the differentiation of material originating from plants that photosynthesize using the C4 mechanism from those that undergo C3 photosynthesis. We conclude that the offshore lignins derive from erosion of the extensive grassland (C4) soils of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and that the nearshore lignins originate largely from C3 plant detritus from coastal forests and swamps. This distribution is probably due to the hydrodynamic sorting of the different source materials during their seaward transport. These results suggest that previous studies have significantly underestimated the terrigenous fraction of organic matter in offshore sediments by not recognizing the contribution of C4 vegetation to the carbon-isotope composition. Such an underestimate may force revisions in the assessment of past marine primary productivity and associated organic carbon fluxes, and of organic matter preservation/remineralization and nutrient cycling in marine sediments.},

Inorganic nitrogen concentrations are consequently very low in surface waters of temperate ocean gyres, yet fixed nitrogen persists in the form of dissolved organic matter. The small, rapidly cycling organic compounds fundamental to microbial and planktonic growth (such as free amino acids, amines and urea) account for only a minor fraction of total dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}). In contrast, the vast majority of {DON}, especially in the deep ocean, resides in the form of nitrogenous substances that are resistant to biological degradation. These substances, which represent an enormous reservoir of fixed nitrogen, are not readily identified by conventional biochemical techniques, but have been assumed to consist largely of structurally complex macromolecules resulting from the degradation and spontaneous abiotic condensation of biochemical precursors. Here we present 15N {NMR} measurements that contradict this view. Our results show that most higher-molecular-weight {DON} in the ocean exists in amide form, rather than as a collection of nitrogen heterocycles that might be indicative of spontaneous condensation products. Because these amides are unlikely to form abiotically, the bulk of the ocean's {DON} reservoir appears to derive directly from degradation-resistant biomolecules.},

We know very little about geographical variability in the remineralization depth of this sinking material and less about what controls such variability. Here we present previously unpublished profiles of mesopelagic {POC} flux derived from neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed in the North Atlantic, from which we calculate the remineralization length scale for each site. Combining these results with corresponding data from the North Pacific, we show that the observed variability in attenuation of vertical {POC} flux can largely be explained by temperature, with shallower remineralization occurring in warmer waters. This is seemingly inconsistent with conclusions drawn from earlier analyses of deep-sea sediment trap and export flux data, which suggest lowest transfer efficiency at high latitudes. However, the two patterns can be reconciled by considering relatively intense remineralization of a labile fraction of material in warm waters, followed by efficient downward transfer of the remaining refractory fraction, while in cold environments, a larger labile fraction undergoes slower remineralization that continues over a longer length scale. Based on the observed relationship, future increases in ocean temperature will likely lead to shallower remineralization of {POC} and hence reduced storage of {CO}2 by the ocean.},

Free-living cells live in a dilute and complex substrate field, and to gain enough substrate, their extracellular enzymes must be utilized efficiently. The model revealed that surface-attached and free enzymes generate unique enzyme and substrate fields, and each deployment strategy has distinctive advantages. For a solitary cell, surface-attached enzymes are suggested to be the most cost-efficient strategy. This strategy entails potential substrates being reduced to very low concentrations. Free enzymes, on the other hand, generate a radically different substrate field, which suggests significant benefits for the strategy if free cells engage in social foraging or experience high substrate concentrations. Swimming has a slight positive effect for the attached-enzyme strategy, while the effect is negative for the free-enzyme strategy. The results of this study suggest that specific dissolved organic compounds in the ocean likely persist below a threshold concentration impervious to biological utilization. This could help explain the persistence and apparent refractory state of oceanic dissolved organic matter ({DOM}). Microbial extracellular enzyme strategies, therefore, have important implications for larger-scale processes, such as shaping the role of {DOM} in ocean carbon sequestration.},

In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring ∼6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

Protists are single-celled organisms complete with nuclei, organelles, and symbionts, and possess a multiplicity of physiological talents. They are ubiquitous, abundant, and often neglected by science. Worden et al. review the challenges of understanding the role protists play in geochemical cycling in the oceans. These organisms can photosynthesize like plants, graze on bacteria and archaea, parasitize each other and bigger creatures, have sex, and sometimes do all these things serially as conditions change. Their activities may have a significant influence on carbon cycling, and research efforts need to be amplified to understand their functional importance in marine ecosystems.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1257594
Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUND} Marine ecosystems are composed of a diverse array of life forms, the majority of which are unicellular—archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. The power of these microbes to process carbon, shape Earth’s atmosphere, and fuel marine food webs has been established over the past 40 years. The marine biosphere is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, rivaling that of land plants. Unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are major contributors to this ocean productivity. In addition to photosynthetic growth, protists exhibit a range of other trophic modes, including predation, mixotrophy (a combination of photosynthetic and predatory-based nutrition), parasitism, symbiosis, osmotrophy, and saprotrophy (wherein extracellular enzymes break down organic matter to smaller compounds that are then transported into the cell by osmotrophy).
{ADVANCES} Sensitive field approaches have illuminated the enormous diversity of protistan life (much of it uncultured) and, coupled with activity measurements, are leading to hypotheses about their ecological roles. In parallel, large-scale sequencing projects are providing fundamental advances in knowledge of genome/gene composition, especially among photosynthetic lineages, many of which are complex amalgams derived from multiple endosymbiotic mergers. Marine protists have yielded insight into basic biology, evolution, and molecular machineries that control organismal responses to the environment. These studies reveal tightly controlled signaling and transcriptional regulation as well as responses to limitation of resources such as iron, nitrogen, and vitamins, and offer understanding of animal and plant evolution. With the formulation of better computational approaches, hypotheses about interactions and trophic exchanges are becoming more exact and modelers more assertive at integrating different data types. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are being reported in multiple systems, of which polar environments are the touchstone of change.
{OUTLOOK} Driven by the need to translate the biology of cells into processes at global scales, researchers must bring the conceptual framework of systems biology into bigger “ecosystems biology” models that broadly capture the geochemical activities of interacting plankton networks. Existing data show that protists are major components of marine food webs, but deducing and quantifying their ecosystem linkages and the resulting influences on carbon cycling is difficult. Genome-based functional predictions are complicated by the importance of cellular structures and flexible behaviors in protists, which are inherently more difficult to infer than the biochemical pathways typically studied in prokaryotes. Alongside the plethora of genes of unknown function, manipulable genetic systems are rare for marine protists. The development of genetic systems and gene editing for diverse, ecologically important lineages, as well as innovative tools for preserving microbe-microbe interactions during sampling, for visual observation, and for quantifying biogeochemical transformations, are critical but attainable goals. These must be implemented in both field work and laboratory physiology studies that examine multiple environmental factors. Expanding genome functional predictions to identify the molecular underpinnings of protistan trophic modes and realistically constrain metabolism will position the field to build reliable cell systems biology models and link these to field studies. By factoring in true complexities, we can capture key elements of protistan interactions for assimilation into more predictive global carbon cycle models. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6223/1257594/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Global biogeochemical and ecological models rely on understanding organismal biology and the interactions occurring in marine microbial food webs. Protists have multifarious roles from the sunlit surface ocean to leagues below. Understanding of protistan behaviors and adaptability lags far behind knowledge of evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomes. As such, microbial mediation of carbon fluxes and specific interactions remain ill-resolved and predictive capabilities are still weak. Strategies to narrow this gap involve iteration between experimental and observational field studies, controlled laboratory experiments, systems biology approaches that preserve cellular structures and behaviors using relevant model taxa, and computational approaches.
The profound influence of marine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires—a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences. We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.},

Although primary production rates vary markedly across this 9° swath, vertical trends in biochemical compositions remained remarkably parallel. Together these one hundred plus biochemicals account for 80\% of the total organic carbon (C org) in net-plankton and particles sinking from the euphotic zone, but represent only 24 and 20\% of the organic carbon in deep-water particles and surface sediments, respectively. Scaled profiles of relative abundances, clearly illustrate (a) exponential losses of plankton remains and increases in heterotroph biomarkers throughout the water column, (b) elevated proportions of bacterial markers near the sediment surface, and (c) preservation of selected remains of bacteria, phytoplankton and vascular land plants deeper in the sediments. In spite of one of the most comprehensive analyses of major biochemicals yet applied to marine particulate samples, percentages of molecularly uncharacterized organic carbon increase progressively down the water column to values near 80\% in the underlying sediments.

	abstract = {Marine sinking particles transport carbon from the surface and bury it in deep-sea sediments, where it can be sequestered on geologic time scales. The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

	abstract = {While the impact of light on primary productivity in aquatic systems has been studied for decades, the role light plays in the degradation of photosynthetically-produced biomass is less well understood. We investigated the patterns of light-induced particle breakdown and bacterial assimilation of detrital C and N using 13C and 15N labeled freeze-thawed diatom cells incubated in laboratory microcosms with a marine microbial community freshly-collected from the Pacific Ocean. Particles incubated in the dark resulted in increased bacterial counts and dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to those incubated in the light. Light also influenced the attached and free-living microbial community structure as detected by 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing. For example, bacterial taxa from the Sphingobacteriia were enriched on dark-incubated particles and taxa from the family Flavobacteriaceae and the genus Pseudoalteromonas were numerically enriched on particles in the light. Isotope incorporation analysis by phylogenetic microarray and {NanoSIMS} (a method called Chip-{SIP}) identified free-living and attached microbial taxa able to incorporate N and C from the particles. Some taxa, including members of the Flavobacteriaceae and Cryomorphaceae, exhibited increased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting the use of photoheterotrophic metabolisms. In contrast, some members of Oceanospirillales and Rhodospirillales showed decreased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting that their heterotrophic metabolism, particularly when occurring on particles, might increase at night or may be inhibited by sunlight. These results show that light influences particle degradation and C and N incorporation by attached bacteria, suggesting that the transfer between particulate and free-living phases are likely affected by external factors that change with the light regime, such as time of day, depth and season.},

	abstract = {Energy-starved microbes in deep marine sediments subsist at near-zero growth for thousands of years, yet the mechanisms for their subsistence are unknown because no model strains have been cultivated from most of these groups. We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group {OPB}41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group {II} lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and {NAD}+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group {OPB}41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes ({SAGs}) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter {YddG} was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies.
{IMPORTANCE} Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.},

By using a shotgun proteomic approach, a total of 3035 proteins matching one or more peptides were detected from four {POM} samples, 505 of which were identified as high-confidence proteins matching two or more peptides. Cyanobacteria was the largest contributor throughout the water column, while crustaceans and dinophytes were the two major groups contributing to the particulate proteins in the {POM} collected from 200 m. Subcellular locations and biological processes of particulate proteins varied significantly between the 41-m and 200-m layers: photosynthesis-associated proteins were highly abundant in the 41-m layer while tubulins and actins accumulated in the midwaters, especially at the 200-m layer. Porins, adenosine triphosphate synthases, nutrient transporters, molecular chaperones, and ectoenzymes were frequently detected in the {POM} samples and presented different distribution patterns within the water column, revealing complex biological processes at the different water layers and/or during the sinking of {POM}. The sources of surface and midwater particulate proteins are different, and the cellular metabolism, generation of energy, and transport processes in {POM} are attenuated rapidly down ocean water column. Zooplankton fecal pellet packages and membrane encapsulation might play important roles in protecting particulate proteins from degradation.},

The material not identified at the molecular level is called “uncharacterized”. Several processes account for this transformation of organic matter: aggregation/disaggregation of particles resulting in incorporation of older and more degraded material; recombination of organic compounds into geomacromolecules; and selective preservation of specific biomacromolecules. Furthermore, microbial activities may introduce new cell wall or other biomass material that is not easily characterized, or they may produce such material as a metabolic product. In addition, black carbon produced by combustion processes may compose a fraction of the uncharacterized organic matter, as it is not analyzed in standard biochemical techniques. Despite these poorly-defined compositional changes that hinder chemical identification, the vast majority of organic matter in sinking particles remains accessible to and is ultimately remineralized by marine microbes.},

The unrecycled fraction of this organic matter can become buried in ocean sediments, thus sequestering carbon and so influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations3. The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques4. Here, using solid-state 13C {NMR} spectroscopy5, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean4 and the Arabian Sea6. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination7 or microbial biosynthesis8, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

	abstract = {Compositions and fluxes of amino acids and major chloropigments were measured in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean as part of the {US} {JGOFS} {EqPac} program. Fluxes decreased by several orders of magnitude, from 400 to 0.03mg amino acid m−2d−1 and from 9mg to 0.0004μg chloropigment m−2d−1, between production in the surface waters and accumulation at the sea floor. Most rapid losses were in surface waters and at the sediment interface. Losses from the mid-water column were as great as those in surface waters or at the sediment interface, but occurred over a much greater depth range. Export flux estimates based on floating sediment traps were higher near the equator and decreased poleward, similar to primary production. Little meridional difference was apparent in composition of either amino acids or pigments in exported material over the 24° of latitude sampled in spite of the large (factor of 5–6) difference in fluxes. However, pigment composition changed dramatically with depth in the water column, and considerable diagenesis occurred before particles reached the sediment. Pigment compositions suggest that suspended particles were more degraded in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, possibly due to differences in food chain structure. Compositional changes in amino acids occurred in the water column, but were most noticeable at the sediment–seawater interface. Increases in the relative proportions of aspartic acid and glycine with depth were more consistent with preferential preservation within the particulate matrix than with any inherent stability of these compounds to heterotrophic consumption. The contribution of amino acids and pigments to total organic carbon clearly shows that selective degradation of organic matter occurs with depth; this is not evident from total organic carbon data alone. Amino acids contributed about a quarter of the total organic carbon ({OC}) in surface waters and 16\% of the {OC} in sediment; pigments decreased from 1\% of total {OC} in surface waters to {\textless}0.001\% in sediments. Decreases in the contribution of amino acids to total organic carbon may be due to transformation into uncharacterizeable material as well as to respiration.},

Analysis of products from the bacterial degradation of proteins in both seawater and sediment pore water revealed the creation and release of peptide intermediates into the medium. Peptides observed in seawater degradation experiments were all less than 40 amino acids long, whereas sedimentary digestions of the same protein generated peptide fragments in the pore water ranging from 110 to 508 amino acids in length. Neither of the environments demonstrated recurring cleavages adjacent to one amino acid or functional group that might be indicative of the action of a single protease. Instead, it appears that a mixture of bacterial proteases were involved in the degradation of protein. The {MALDI}-{TOF}-{MS} method presented, in combination with these results, can help us delineate some of the processes responsible in the initial stages of degradation and better understand how proteins are partitioned between dissolved and solid phases in marine systems.},

Base-extracted material accounts for {\textasciitilde}30\% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}10\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is relatively enriched in glycine ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%), lysine ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%), and non-protein amino acids ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3–10 and 10–100 {kDa} size fractions ({\textasciitilde}10\% and 42\% of base-extractable {THAA}, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The {\textgreater}100 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}38\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10–100 {kDa} and {\textgreater}100 {kDa}) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.},

Typically, microbial activity in the deep biosphere is calculated by transport-reaction modelling of pore water solutes or from experimental measurements involving radiotracers. Here we modelled microbial activity from the degree of D:L-aspartic acid racemization in microbial necromass (remains of dead microbial biomass) in sediments up to ten million years old. This recently developed approach (D:L-amino acid modelling) does not require incubation experiments and is highly sensitive in stable, low-activity environments. We applied for the first time newly established constraints on several important input parameters of the D:L-amino acid model, such as a higher aspartic acid racemization rate constant and a lower cell-specific carbon content of sub-seafloor microorganisms. Our model results show that the pool of necromass amino acids is turned over by microbial activity every few thousand years, while the turnover times of vegetative cells are in the order of years to decades. Notably, microbial turnover times in million-year-old sediment from the Peru Margin are up to 100-fold shorter than previous estimates, highlighting the influence of microbial activities on element cycling over geologic time scales.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23\% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ∼39\% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40\%, 11\%, and 10\%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.},

	abstract = {Warming at nearly twice the global rate, higher than average air temperatures are the new ‘normal’ for Arctic ecosystems. This rise in temperature has triggered hydrological and geochemical changes that increasingly release carbon-rich water into the coastal ocean via increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of the semi-permanent permafrost ubiquitous in the region. To determine the biogeochemical impacts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter ({tDOM}) on marine ecosystems we compared the nutrient stocks and bacterial communities present under ice-covered and ice-free conditions, assessed the lability of Arctic {tDOM} to coastal microbial communities from the Chukchi Sea, and identified bacterial taxa that respond to rapid increases in {tDOM}. Once thought to be predominantly refractory, we found that ∼7\% of dissolved organic carbon and ∼38\% of dissolved organic nitrogen from {tDOM} was bioavailable to receiving marine microbial communities on short 4 – 6 day time scales. The addition of {tDOM} shifted bacterial community structure toward more copiotrophic taxa and away from more oligotrophic taxa. Although no single order was found to respond universally (positively or negatively) to the {tDOM} addition, this study identified 20 indicator species as possible sentinels for increased {tDOM}. These data suggest the true ecological impact of {tDOM} will be widespread across many bacterial taxa and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated.},
