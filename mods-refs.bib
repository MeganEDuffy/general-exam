	abstract = {Background
Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur containing amino acids in proteins. While the roles of protein-bound cysteinyl residues as endogenous antioxidants are well appreciated, those of methionine remain largely unexplored.

Scope
We summarize the key roles of methionine residues in proteins.

Major Conclusion
Recent studies establish that cysteine and methionine have remarkably similar functions.

General Significance
Both cysteine and methionine serve as important cellular antioxidants, stabilize the structure of proteins, and can act as regulatory switches through reversible oxidation and reduction.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of proteins on a proteome-wide scale. Mass spectrometry plays an important role in the high-throughput study of proteomics. There have been two major advances in mass spectrometry technology: instrumental (including physiochemical) development, such as the development of chromatography, protein ionization and protein labeling technologies; and the development of computational algorithms for the analysis of mass spectra produced by mass spectrometers. In this review, we provide an overview of the development of computational algorithms for de novo peptide sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry.},
