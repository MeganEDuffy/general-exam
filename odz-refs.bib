	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}) caused by water column stratification appear to expand in parts of the world's ocean, with consequences for marine biogeochemical cycles. {OMZ} formation is often fueled by high surface primary production, and sinking organic particles can be hotspots of interactions and activity within microbial communities. This study investigated the diversity of {OMZ} protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({\textgreater}30 and 30-1.6 μm filters) from the world's largest permanent {OMZ} in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina {MiSeq} sequencing of V4 region of 18S {SSU} {rRNA} genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic waters shared only ∼32\% of operational taxonomic unit ({OTU}) (97\% sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7\% of total {OTUs} were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6-30 μm fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

Even after correction for lithogenic and ferruginous–scavenged metals, {ODZ} P-maxima are often enriched in Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn, exhibiting particulate trace metal ratios to P that exceed mixed layer biomass ratios by factors of 2–9. {ODZ} prokaryotic communities may be largely hidden, {TM}–rich pools involved in the marine cycles of these bioactive trace metals.},

The oil and gas seeps are typically overlain by chemosynthetic communities consisting of thiotrophic bacterial mats (Beggiatoa spp.) and methanotrophic mussels (Bathymodiolus spp.), respectively. Cores were recovered with a manned submersible from fine-grained sediments containing dispersed gas hydrates at the threshold of stability. Estimated sulfate reduction rates are variable but generally are substantially higher in crude oil seeps (up to 50 times) and methane seeps (up to 600 times) relative to a non-seep reference sediment (0.0043 μmol {SO}42− cm−3 day−1). Sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation factors are highest in the reference sediment (αS = 1.027; αO = 1.015) but substantially lower in the seep sediments (αS = 1.018 to 1.009; αO = 1.006 to 1.002) and are controlled primarily by kinetic factors related to sulfate reduction rates. Kinetic effects also control the δ34S/δ18O ratios such that slow microbial rates yield low ratios whereas faster rates yield progressively higher ratios. The seep data contradict previous claims that δ34S/δ18O ratios are diagnostic of either microbial sulfate reduction at a fixed δ34S/δ18O ratio of 4/1 or lower ratios caused by {SO}4–H2O equilibration at ambient temperatures. The new results offer a better understanding of methane removal via anaerobic oxidation in the sulfate reduction zone of hydrate-bearing sediments and have significant implications regarding the origin and geochemical history of sedimentary sulfate reconstructed on the basis of δ34S and δ18O compositions.},

The revised estimate of approx. 450 Tg N yr sup(-1) (Tg = 10 sup(12) g) produces an oceanic fixed N budget with a large deficit (approx. 200 Tg N yr sup(1)) that can be explained only by positing an ocean that has deviated far from a steady-state, the need for a major upwards revision of fixed N inputs, particularly nitrogen fixation, or both. Oceanic denitrification can be significantly altered by small re-distributions of carbon and dissolved oxygen. Since fixed N is a limiting nutrient, uncompensated changes in denitrification affect the ocean's ability to sequester atmospheric {CO} sub(2) via the "biological pump". Our concepts of the oceanic N sub(2) O regime to take better account of the extremely high N sub(2)O saturations that can arise in productive, low oxygen waters had to be modified. Recent results from the western Indian Shelf during a period when hypoxic, suboxic and anoxic waters were present produced a maximum surface N sub(2)O saturation of greater than 8000\%, a likely consequence of "stop and go" denitrification. The sensitivity of N sub(2) O production and consumption to small changes in the oceanic dissolved oxygen distribution and to the "spin-up" phase of denitrification suggests that the oceanic source term for N sub(2)O could change rapidly},

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, anammox, in pelagic nitrogen removal. Sources of ammonium for the anammox reaction, however, remain controversial, as heterotrophic denitrification and alternative anaerobic pathways of organic matter remineralization cannot account for the ammonium requirements of reported anammox rates. Here, we explore the significance of microaerobic respiration as a source of ammonium during organic matter degradation in the oxygen-deficient waters off Namibia and Peru. Experiments with additions of double-labelled oxygen revealed high aerobic activity in the upper {OMZs}, likely controlled by surface organic matter export. Consistently observed oxygen consumption in samples retrieved throughout the lower {OMZs} hints at efficient exploitation of vertically and laterally advected, oxygenated waters in this zone by aerobic microorganisms. In accordance, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses identified genes encoding for aerobic terminal oxidases and demonstrated their expression by diverse microbial communities, even in virtually anoxic waters. Our results suggest that microaerobic respiration is a major mode of organic matter remineralization and source of ammonium ({\textasciitilde}45-100\%) in the upper oxygen minimum zones, and reconcile hitherto observed mismatches between ammonium producing and consuming processes therein.},

Aerobic bacteria and ocean circulation patterns control the formation and distribution of oxygen-minimum zones at moderate depth in the oceans. These habitats host microorganisms that thrive on other metabolic substrates in the absence of oxygen—most commonly, metabolizing thermodynamically favorable nitrogen compounds like nitrate. Off the coast of Chile, however, Canfield et al. (p. 1375, published online 11 November; see the Perspective by Teske) suggest that bacteria may often reduce sulfate as well. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of both sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. With the coincidence of sulfate and nitrate reduction, the sulfur and nitrogen cycles may be intimately linked; for example, sulfate reduction could provide nitrogen-rich ammonium for bacteria that ultimately transform it into nitrogen gas.
Nitrogen cycling is normally thought to dominate the biogeochemistry and microbial ecology of oxygen-minimum zones in marine environments. Through a combination of molecular techniques and process rate measurements, we showed that both sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in oxygen-free waters off the coast of northern Chile. These processes may have been overlooked because in nature, the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction immediately oxidizes back to sulfate. This cryptic sulfur cycle is linked to anammox and other nitrogen cycling processes, suggesting that it may influence biogeochemical cycling in the global ocean.
Bacterial sulfur reduction and oxidation accompanies nitrogen cycling where oxygen levels at depth are low.

However, the key carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (S) cycling processes catalyzed by {OMZ} microbial communities are poorly constrained spatially, temporally, and with regard to the different microbial groups involved. Here we sample across dissolved oxygen ({DO}) gradients in the oceans' largest {OMZ} by volume-the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, or {ETNP}-and quantify 16S {rRNA} and functional gene transcripts to detect and constrain the activity of different S-cycling groups. Based on gene expression profiles, putative dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({dsrA}) genes are actively expressed within the {ETNP} {OMZ}. {dsrA} expression was limited almost entirely to samples with elevated nitrite concentrations, consistent with previous observations in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific {OMZ}. {dsrA} and 'reverse' dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({rdsrA}) genes are related and the associated enzymes are known to operate in either direction-reducing or oxidizing different S compounds. We found that {rdsrA} genes and {soxB} genes were expressed in the same samples, suggestive of active S cycling in the {ETNP} {OMZ}. These data provide potential thresholds for S cycling in {OMZs} that closely mimic recent predictions, and indicate that S cycling may be broadly relevant in {OMZs}.},

	abstract = {A major impediment to understanding long-term changes in the marine nitrogen (N) cycle is the persistent uncertainty about the rates, distribution, and sensitivity of its largest fluxes in the modern ocean. We use a global ocean circulation model to obtain the first 3-D estimate of marine denitrification rates that is maximally consistent with available observations of nitrate deficits and the nitrogen isotopic ratio of oceanic nitrate. We find a global rate of marine denitrification in suboxic waters and sediments of 120–240 Tg N yr−1, which is lower than many other recent estimates. The difference stems from the ability to represent the 3-D spatial structure of suboxic zones, where denitrification rates of 50–77 Tg N yr−1 result in up to 50\% depletion of nitrate. This depletion reduces the effect of local isotopic enrichment on the rest of the ocean, allowing the N isotope ratio of oceanic nitrate to be achieved with a sedimentary denitrification rate about 1.3–2.3 times that of suboxic zones. This balance of N losses between sediments and suboxic zones is shown to obey a simple relationship between isotope fractionation and the degree of nitrate consumption in the core of the suboxic zones. The global denitrification rates derived here suggest that the marine nitrogen budget is likely close to balanced.},

On the Washington State margin, where the water column is oxic, rain rates at 100 m were about 15 to 20 mmoles C m−2 d−1 and they decreased with increasing water depth to values of near 3 mmoles C m−2 d−1 at 1,000 m. The rain rate estimates, {CR}, were described by a power function, {CR} = {CR}100m(z/100)−α, with an attenuation coefficient, α, of 0.93 ({CR}100m = 16.2, r2 = 0.89). This attenuation rate is similar to numerous others previously reported for various oceanic areas. In contrast, off northwest Mexico, where the water column is oxygen deficient between 180 and 700 m, rain rates at 100 m were considerably less, about 7.5 mmoles C m−2 d−1, but rain rates at 1,000 m were similar to those off Washington. Thus, the attenuation coefficient for the Mexican margin was significantly lower, α = 0.36 ({CR}100m = 7.4, r2 = 0.77). Off Mexico, the rain rates estimated from sedimentary parameters were corroborated by values determined directly from sediment-trap deployments. The generally smaller rain rates off Mexico are probably due to the lower primary production, hence lower initial supply. The lower attenuation rate, however, is hypothesized to result from a decreased oxidation rate of the sinking flux within the oxygen-deficient zone relative to a more typical oxic water column.},

	abstract = {Today, over 90\% of all organic carbon burial in the ocean occurs in continental margin sediments. This burial is intrinsically linked to the cycling of biogeochemically important elements (such as N, P, S, Fe and Mn) and, on geological timescales, largely controls the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Currently there is a volatile debate over which processes govern sedimentary organic carbon preservation. In spite of numerous studies demonstrating empirical relationships between organic carbon burial and such factors as primary productivity, the flux of organic carbon through the water column, sedimentation rate,, organic carbon degradation rate, and bottom-water oxygen concentration,, the mechanisms directly controlling sedimentary organic carbon preservation remain unclear. Furthermore, as organic carbon burial is the process that, along with pyrite burial, balances O2 concentrations in the atmosphere, it is desirable that any mechanism proposed to control organic carbon preservation include a feedback buffering atmospheric oxygen concentrations over geological time. Here we compare analyses of sediments underlying two regions of the eastern North Pacific Ocean, one which has oxygen-depleted bottom waters and one with typical oxygen distributions. Organic carbon burial efficiency is strongly correlated with the length of time accumulating particles are exposed to molecular oxygen in sediment pore waters. Oxygen exposure time effectively incorporates other proposed environmental variables, and may exert a direct control on sedimentary organic carbon preservation and atmospheric oxygen concentrations.},

We combined rate measurements with metatranscriptomics to quantify {PA} and {FL} microbial activity in the oxygen minimum zone ({OMZ}) of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, focusing on dissimilatory processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle. Bacterial gene counts were 8- to 15-fold higher in the {FL} compared with the {PA} fraction. However, rates of all measured N cycle processes, excluding ammonia oxidation, declined significantly following particle ({\textgreater}1.6 μm) removal. Without particles, rates of nitrate reduction to nitrite (1.5–9.4nMNd−1) fell to zero and N2 production by denitrification (0.5–1.7nMNd−1) and anammox (0.3–1.9nMNd−1) declined by 53–85\%. The proportional representation of major microbial taxa and N cycle gene transcripts in metatranscriptomes followed fraction-specific trends. Transcripts encoding nitrate reductase were uniform among {PA} and {FL} fractions, whereas anammox-associated transcripts were proportionately enriched up to 15-fold in the {FL} fraction. In contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes for N2O and N2 production by denitrification were enriched up to 28-fold in {PA} samples. These patterns suggest that the majority of N cycle activity, excluding N2O and N2 production by denitrification, is confined to a {FL} majority that is critically dependent on access to particles, likely as a source of organic carbon and inorganic N. Variable particle distributions may drive heterogeneity in N cycle activity and gene expression in {OMZs}.},

	abstract = {Marine oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}) support diverse microbial communities with roles in major elemental cycles. It is unclear how the taxonomic composition and metabolism of {OMZ} microorganisms vary between particle-associated and free-living size fractions. We used amplicon (16S {rRNA} gene) and shotgun metagenome sequencing to compare microbial communities from large ({\textgreater}1.6 μm) and small (0.2-1.6 μm) filter size fractions along a depth gradient in the {OMZ} off Chile. Despite steep vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger predictor of community composition compared to depth. Phylogenetic diversity showed contrasting patterns, decreasing towards the anoxic {OMZ} core in the small size fraction, but exhibiting maximal values at these depths within the larger size fraction. Fraction-specific distributions were evident for key {OMZ} taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0.2-1.6 μm community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions, with the {\textgreater}1.6 μm community significantly enriched in genes mediating social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity. Prokaryotic transposase genes were three to six fold more abundant in this fraction, comprising up to 2\% of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that particle surfaces may act as hotbeds for transposition-based genome changes in marine microbes. Genes for nitric and nitrous oxide reduction were also more abundant (three to seven fold) in the larger size fraction, suggesting microniche partitioning of key denitrification steps. These results highlight an important role for surface attachment in shaping community metabolic potential and genome content in {OMZ} microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Ocean ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes of their physical, chemical and biological environment. Among these changes, warming, acidification, deoxygenation and changes in primary productivity by marine phytoplankton can be considered as four of the major stressors of open ocean ecosystems. Due to rising atmospheric {CO}2 in the coming decades, these changes will be amplified. Here, we use the most recent simulations performed in the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 to assess how these stressors may evolve over the course of the 21st century. The 10 Earth system models used here project similar trends in ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation and reduced primary productivity for each of the {IPCC}'s representative concentration pathways ({RCPs}) over the 21st century. For the "business-as-usual" scenario {RCP}8.5, the model-mean changes in the 2090s (compared to the 1990s) for sea surface temperature, sea surface {pH}, global O2 content and integrated primary productivity amount to +2.73 (±0.72) °C, −0.33 (±0.003) {pH} unit, −3.45 (±0.44)\% and −8.6 (±7.9)\%, respectively. For the high mitigation scenario {RCP}2.6, corresponding changes are +0.71 (±0.45) °C, −0.07 (±0.001) {pH} unit, −1.81 (±0.31)\% and −2.0 (±4.1)\%, respectively, illustrating the effectiveness of extreme mitigation strategies. Although these stressors operate globally, they display distinct regional patterns and thus do not change coincidentally. Large decreases in O2 and in {pH} are simulated in global ocean intermediate and mode waters, whereas large reductions in primary production are simulated in the tropics and in the North Atlantic. Although temperature and {pH} projections are robust across models, the same does not hold for projections of subsurface O2 concentrations in the tropics and global and regional changes in net primary productivity. These high uncertainties in projections of primary productivity and subsurface oxygen prompt us to continue inter-model comparisons to understand these model differences, while calling for caution when using the {CMIP}5 models to force regional impact models.},

Here we use metaproteomics to chart spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression along defined redox gradients in a seasonally stratified fjord to better understand microbial community responses to {OMZ} expansion. The expression of metabolic pathway components for nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), denitrification, and inorganic carbon fixation were differentially expressed across the redoxcline and covaried with distribution patterns of ubiquitous {OMZ} microbes including Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospina, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes, and {SUP}05/{ARCTIC}96BD-19 Gammaproteobacteria. Nitrification and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with Thaumarchaeota dominated dysoxic waters, and denitrification, sulfur oxidation, and inorganic carbon fixation pathways affiliated with the {SUP}05 group of nitrate-reducing sulfur oxidizers dominated suboxic and anoxic waters. Nitrifier nitrite oxidation and anammox pathways affiliated with Nirospina, Nitrospira, and Planctomycetes, respectively, also exhibited redox partitioning between dysoxic and suboxic waters. The numerical abundance of {SUP}05 proteins mediating inorganic carbon fixation under anoxic conditions suggests that {SUP}05 will become increasingly important in global ocean carbon and nutrient cycling as {OMZs} expand.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are the most abundant lifeform on Earth, mediating global fluxes of matter and energy. Over the past decade, high-throughput molecular techniques generating multiomic sequence information ({DNA}, {mRNA}, and protein) have transformed our perception of this microcosmos, conceptually linking microorganisms at the individual, population, and community levels to a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. Here, we develop a biogeochemical model that describes metabolic coupling along the redox gradient in Saanich Inlet—a seasonally anoxic fjord with biogeochemistry analogous to oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}). The model reproduces measured biogeochemical process rates as well as {DNA}, {mRNA}, and protein concentration profiles across the redox gradient. Simulations make predictions about the role of ubiquitous {OMZ} microorganisms in mediating carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. For example, nitrite “leakage” during incomplete sulfide-driven denitrification by {SUP}05 Gammaproteobacteria is predicted to support inorganic carbon fixation and intense nitrogen loss via anaerobic ammonium oxidation. This coupling creates a metabolic niche for nitrous oxide reduction that completes denitrification by currently unidentified community members. These results quantitatively improve previous conceptual models describing microbial metabolic networks in {OMZs}. Beyond {OMZ}-specific predictions, model results indicate that geochemical fluxes are robust indicators of microbial community structure and reciprocally, that gene abundances and geochemical conditions largely determine gene expression patterns. The integration of real observational data, including geochemical profiles and process rate measurements as well as metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic sequence data, into a biogeochemical model, as shown here, enables holistic insight into the microbial metabolic network driving nutrient and energy flow at ecosystem scales.},

The resulting expansion of the oxygen minimum zone has consequences for the region’s ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, but the causes of the oxygen decline are not yet fully understood. Here we combine models of atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling to test the hypothesis that atmospheric pollution over the Pacific Ocean contributed to the redistribution of oxygen in deeper waters. We simulate the pollution-induced enhancement of atmospheric soluble iron and fixed nitrogen deposition, as well as its impacts on ocean productivity and biogeochemical cycling for the late twentieth century. The model reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen changes from the 1970s to the 1990s, and the sensitivity experiments reveal the reinforcing effects of pollution-enhanced iron deposition and natural climate variability. Despite the aerosol deposition being the largest in mid-latitudes, its effect on oceanic oxygen is most pronounced in the tropics, where ocean circulation transports added iron to the tropics, leading to an increased regional productivity, respiration and subsurface oxygen depletion. These results suggest that anthropogenic pollution can interact and amplify climate-driven impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, even in remote ocean biomes.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}) harbor unique microbial communities that rely on alternative electron acceptors for respiration. Conditions therein enable an almost complete nitrogen (N) cycle and substantial N-loss. N-loss in {OMZs} is attributable to anammox and heterotrophic denitrification, whereas nitrate reduction to nitrite along with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium are major remineralization pathways. Despite virtually anoxic conditions, nitrification also occurs in {OMZs}, converting remineralized ammonium to N-oxides. The concurrence of all these processes provides a direct channel from organic N to the ultimate N-loss, whereas most individual processes are likely controlled by organic matter. Many microorganisms inhabiting the {OMZs} are capable of multiple functions in the N- and other elemental cycles. Their versatile metabolic potentials versus actual activities present a challenge to ecophysiological and biogeochemical measurements. These challenges need to be tackled before we can realistically predict how N-cycling in {OMZs}, and thus oceanic N-balance, will respond to future global perturbations.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd), a trace nutrient for marine algae, has a marine distribution that closely matches the macronutrients nitrate and phosphate. Sedimentary microfossil records of Cd provide reconstructions of past ocean nutrient distributions that facilitate understanding the role of the oceans in the carbon cycle and climate change. However, incomplete knowledge of processes that control the addition and removal of Cd in the ocean, and Cd’s variability relative to major nutrients, limit use of the paleoceanographic proxy. We present coupled data of Cd concentration and isotopic composition in seawater and suspended marine particles, indicating direct removal of Cd via coprecipitation with sulfide in oxygen-deficient waters. Thus, the marine Cd cycle may be highly sensitive to the extent of global oceanic oxygen depletion., Cadmium (Cd) is a micronutrient and a tracer of biological productivity and circulation in the ocean. The correlation between dissolved Cd and the major algal nutrients in seawater has led to the use of Cd preserved in microfossils to constrain past ocean nutrient distributions. However, linking Cd to marine biological processes requires constraints on marine sources and sinks of Cd. Here, we show a decoupling between Cd and major nutrients within oxygen-deficient zones ({ODZs}) in both the Northeast Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, which we attribute to Cd sulfide ({CdS}) precipitation in euxinic microenvironments around sinking biological particles. We find that dissolved Cd correlates well with dissolved phosphate in oxygenated waters, but is depleted compared with phosphate in {ODZs}. Additionally, suspended particles from the North Atlantic show high Cd content and light Cd stable isotope ratios within the {ODZ}, indicative of {CdS} precipitation. Globally, we calculate that {CdS} precipitation in {ODZs} is an important, and to our knowledge a previously undocumented marine sink of Cd. Our results suggest that water column oxygen depletion has a substantial impact on Cd biogeochemical cycling, impacting the global relationship between Cd and major nutrients and suggesting that Cd may be a previously unidentified tracer for water column oxygen deficiency on geological timescales. Similar depletions of copper and zinc in the Northeast Pacific indicate that sulfide precipitation in {ODZs} may also have an influence on the global distribution of other trace metals.},

	abstract = {Bottom-water oxygen supply is a key factor governing the biogeochemistry and community composition of marine sediments. Whether it also determines carbon burial rates remains controversial. We investigated the effect of varying oxygen concentrations (170 to 0 μM O2) on microbial remineralization of organic matter in seafloor sediments and on community diversity of the northwestern Crimean shelf break. This study shows that 50\% more organic matter is preserved in surface sediments exposed to hypoxia compared to oxic bottom waters. Hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decreased remineralization rates even within short periods of a few days. These conditions led to the accumulation of threefold more phytodetritus pigments within 40 years compared to the oxic zone. Bacterial community structure also differed between oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic zones. Functional groups relevant in the degradation of particulate organic matter, such as Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, changed with decreasing oxygenation, and the microbial community of the hypoxic zone took longer to degrade similar amounts of deposited reactive matter. We conclude that hypoxic bottom-water conditions—even on short time scales—substantially increase the preservation potential of organic matter because of the negative effects on benthic fauna and particle mixing and by favoring anaerobic processes, including sulfurization of matter.
Hypoxia enhances organic matter preservation in marine sediments by changing benthic communities, bioturbation, and burial rates.

	abstract = {In the modern ocean, oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}) are potential traces of a primitive ocean in which Archean bacteria lived and reduced chemical anomalies occurred. But {OMZs} are also keys to understanding the present unbalanced nitrogen cycle and the oceans’ role on atmospheric greenhouse control. {OMZs} are the main areas of nitrogen loss (as N2, N2O) to the atmosphere through denitriﬁcation and anammox, and could even indirectly mitigate the oceanic biological sequestration of {CO}2. It was recently hypothesized that {OMZs} are going to spread in the coming decades as a consequence of global climate change. Despite an important {OMZ} role for the origin of marine life and for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, there are some key questions on the structure of {OMZs} at a global scale. There is no agreement concerning the threshold in oxygen that deﬁnes an {OMZ}, and the extent of an {OMZ} is often evaluated by denitriﬁcation criteria which, at the same time, are O2-dependent.},
