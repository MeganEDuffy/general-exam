	abstract = {The fluxes of individual carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and pigments have been determined in net-plankton, particulate matter and sediments from three sites (9°N, 5°N, and 0°N) in the central equatorial Pacific to evaluate sources and reactivities of organic compounds. Although primary production rates vary markedly across this 9° swath, vertical trends in biochemical compositions remained remarkably parallel. Together these one hundred plus biochemicals account for 80\% of the total organic carbon (C org) in net-plankton and particles sinking from the euphotic zone, but represent only 24 and 20\% of the organic carbon in deep-water particles and surface sediments, respectively. Scaled profiles of relative abundances, clearly illustrate (a) exponential losses of plankton remains and increases in heterotroph biomarkers throughout the water column, (b) elevated proportions of bacterial markers near the sediment surface, and (c) preservation of selected remains of bacteria, phytoplankton and vascular land plants deeper in the sediments. In spite of one of the most comprehensive analyses of major biochemicals yet applied to marine particulate samples, percentages of molecularly uncharacterized organic carbon increase progressively down the water column to values near 80\% in the underlying sediments. The composition, formation pathway and information potential of this uncharatterized fraction are among the most fascinating questions in marine organic geochemistry.},

	abstract = {Marine sinking particles transport carbon from the surface and bury it in deep-sea sediments, where it can be sequestered on geologic time scales. The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

	abstract = {While the impact of light on primary productivity in aquatic systems has been studied for decades, the role light plays in the degradation of photosynthetically-produced biomass is less well understood. We investigated the patterns of light-induced particle breakdown and bacterial assimilation of detrital C and N using 13C and 15N labeled freeze-thawed diatom cells incubated in laboratory microcosms with a marine microbial community freshly-collected from the Pacific Ocean. Particles incubated in the dark resulted in increased bacterial counts and dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to those incubated in the light. Light also influenced the attached and free-living microbial community structure as detected by 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing. For example, bacterial taxa from the Sphingobacteriia were enriched on dark-incubated particles and taxa from the family Flavobacteriaceae and the genus Pseudoalteromonas were numerically enriched on particles in the light. Isotope incorporation analysis by phylogenetic microarray and {NanoSIMS} (a method called Chip-{SIP}) identified free-living and attached microbial taxa able to incorporate N and C from the particles. Some taxa, including members of the Flavobacteriaceae and Cryomorphaceae, exhibited increased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting the use of photoheterotrophic metabolisms. In contrast, some members of Oceanospirillales and Rhodospirillales showed decreased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting that their heterotrophic metabolism, particularly when occurring on particles, might increase at night or may be inhibited by sunlight. These results show that light influences particle degradation and C and N incorporation by attached bacteria, suggesting that the transfer between particulate and free-living phases are likely affected by external factors that change with the light regime, such as time of day, depth and season.},

	abstract = {Energy-starved microbes in deep marine sediments subsist at near-zero growth for thousands of years, yet the mechanisms for their subsistence are unknown because no model strains have been cultivated from most of these groups. We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group {OPB}41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group {II} lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and {NAD}+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group {OPB}41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes ({SAGs}) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter {YddG} was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies.
{IMPORTANCE} Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.},

By using a shotgun proteomic approach, a total of 3035 proteins matching one or more peptides were detected from four {POM} samples, 505 of which were identified as high-confidence proteins matching two or more peptides. Cyanobacteria was the largest contributor throughout the water column, while crustaceans and dinophytes were the two major groups contributing to the particulate proteins in the {POM} collected from 200 m. Subcellular locations and biological processes of particulate proteins varied significantly between the 41-m and 200-m layers: photosynthesis-associated proteins were highly abundant in the 41-m layer while tubulins and actins accumulated in the midwaters, especially at the 200-m layer. Porins, adenosine triphosphate synthases, nutrient transporters, molecular chaperones, and ectoenzymes were frequently detected in the {POM} samples and presented different distribution patterns within the water column, revealing complex biological processes at the different water layers and/or during the sinking of {POM}. The sources of surface and midwater particulate proteins are different, and the cellular metabolism, generation of energy, and transport processes in {POM} are attenuated rapidly down ocean water column. Zooplankton fecal pellet packages and membrane encapsulation might play important roles in protecting particulate proteins from degradation.},

The material not identified at the molecular level is called “uncharacterized”. Several processes account for this transformation of organic matter: aggregation/disaggregation of particles resulting in incorporation of older and more degraded material; recombination of organic compounds into geomacromolecules; and selective preservation of specific biomacromolecules. Furthermore, microbial activities may introduce new cell wall or other biomass material that is not easily characterized, or they may produce such material as a metabolic product. In addition, black carbon produced by combustion processes may compose a fraction of the uncharacterized organic matter, as it is not analyzed in standard biochemical techniques. Despite these poorly-defined compositional changes that hinder chemical identification, the vast majority of organic matter in sinking particles remains accessible to and is ultimately remineralized by marine microbes.},

The unrecycled fraction of this organic matter can become buried in ocean sediments, thus sequestering carbon and so influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations3. The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques4. Here, using solid-state 13C {NMR} spectroscopy5, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean4 and the Arabian Sea6. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination7 or microbial biosynthesis8, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

	abstract = {Compositions and fluxes of amino acids and major chloropigments were measured in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean as part of the {US} {JGOFS} {EqPac} program. Fluxes decreased by several orders of magnitude, from 400 to 0.03mg amino acid m−2d−1 and from 9mg to 0.0004μg chloropigment m−2d−1, between production in the surface waters and accumulation at the sea floor. Most rapid losses were in surface waters and at the sediment interface. Losses from the mid-water column were as great as those in surface waters or at the sediment interface, but occurred over a much greater depth range. Export flux estimates based on floating sediment traps were higher near the equator and decreased poleward, similar to primary production. Little meridional difference was apparent in composition of either amino acids or pigments in exported material over the 24° of latitude sampled in spite of the large (factor of 5–6) difference in fluxes. However, pigment composition changed dramatically with depth in the water column, and considerable diagenesis occurred before particles reached the sediment. Pigment compositions suggest that suspended particles were more degraded in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, possibly due to differences in food chain structure. Compositional changes in amino acids occurred in the water column, but were most noticeable at the sediment–seawater interface. Increases in the relative proportions of aspartic acid and glycine with depth were more consistent with preferential preservation within the particulate matrix than with any inherent stability of these compounds to heterotrophic consumption. The contribution of amino acids and pigments to total organic carbon clearly shows that selective degradation of organic matter occurs with depth; this is not evident from total organic carbon data alone. Amino acids contributed about a quarter of the total organic carbon ({OC}) in surface waters and 16\% of the {OC} in sediment; pigments decreased from 1\% of total {OC} in surface waters to {\textless}0.001\% in sediments. Decreases in the contribution of amino acids to total organic carbon may be due to transformation into uncharacterizeable material as well as to respiration.},

Analysis of products from the bacterial degradation of proteins in both seawater and sediment pore water revealed the creation and release of peptide intermediates into the medium. Peptides observed in seawater degradation experiments were all less than 40 amino acids long, whereas sedimentary digestions of the same protein generated peptide fragments in the pore water ranging from 110 to 508 amino acids in length. Neither of the environments demonstrated recurring cleavages adjacent to one amino acid or functional group that might be indicative of the action of a single protease. Instead, it appears that a mixture of bacterial proteases were involved in the degradation of protein.

Base-extracted material accounts for {\textasciitilde}30\% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}10\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is relatively enriched in glycine ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%), lysine ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%), and non-protein amino acids ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3–10 and 10–100 {kDa} size fractions ({\textasciitilde}10\% and 42\% of base-extractable {THAA}, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The {\textgreater}100 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}38\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10–100 {kDa} and {\textgreater}100 {kDa}) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.},

Typically, microbial activity in the deep biosphere is calculated by transport-reaction modelling of pore water solutes or from experimental measurements involving radiotracers. Here we modelled microbial activity from the degree of D:L-aspartic acid racemization in microbial necromass (remains of dead microbial biomass) in sediments up to ten million years old. This recently developed approach (D:L-amino acid modelling) does not require incubation experiments and is highly sensitive in stable, low-activity environments. We applied for the first time newly established constraints on several important input parameters of the D:L-amino acid model, such as a higher aspartic acid racemization rate constant and a lower cell-specific carbon content of sub-seafloor microorganisms. Our model results show that the pool of necromass amino acids is turned over by microbial activity every few thousand years, while the turnover times of vegetative cells are in the order of years to decades. Notably, microbial turnover times in million-year-old sediment from the Peru Margin are up to 100-fold shorter than previous estimates, highlighting the influence of microbial activities on element cycling over geologic time scales.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23\% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ∼39\% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40\%, 11\%, and 10\%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.},
