	abstract = {The advent of genomic‐, transcriptomic‐ and proteomic‐based approaches has revolutionized our ability to describe marine microbial communities, including biogeography, metabolic potential and diversity, mechanisms of adaptation, and phylogeny and evolutionary history. New interdisciplinary approaches are needed to move from this descriptive level to improved quantitative, process‐level understanding of the roles of marine microbes in biogeochemical cycles and of the impact of environmental change on the marine microbial ecosystem. Linking studies at levels from the genome to the organism, to ecological strategies and organism and ecosystem response, requires new modelling approaches. Key to this will be a fundamental shift in modelling scale that represents micro‐organisms from the level of their macromolecular components. This will enable contact with omics data sets and allow acclimation and adaptive response at the phenotype level (i.e. traits) to be simulated as a combination of fitness maximization and evolutionary constraints. This way forward will build on ecological approaches that identify key organism traits and systems biology approaches that integrate traditional physiological measurements with new insights from omics. It will rely on developing an improved understanding of ecophysiology to understand quantitatively environmental controls on microbial growth strategies. It will also incorporate results from experimental evolution studies in the representation of adaptation. The resulting ecosystem‐level models can then evaluate our level of understanding of controls on ecosystem structure and function, highlight major gaps in understanding and help prioritize areas for future research programs. Ultimately, this grand synthesis should improve predictive capability of the ecosystem response to multiple environmental drivers.},

	abstract = {Author Summary In recent years, meta-omic (including metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) techniques have been adopted as complementary approaches to metagenomic sequencing to study functional characteristics and dynamics of microbial communities, aiming at a holistic understanding of a community to respond to the changes in the environment. Currently, metaproteomic data are largely analyzed using the bioinformatics tools originally designed in bottom-up proteomics. In particular, recent metaproteomic studies employed a metagenome-guided approach, in which complete or fragmental protein-coding genes were first predicted from metagenomic sequences (i.e., contigs or scaffolds), acquired from the matched community samples, and predicted protein sequences were then used in peptide identification. A key challenge of this approach is that the protein coding genes predicted from assembled metagenomic contigs can be incomplete and fragmented due to the complexity of metagenomic samples and the short reads length in metagenomic sequencing. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a graph-centric approach that exploits the de bruijn graph structure reported by metagenome assembly algorithms to improve metagenome-guided peptide and protein identification in metaproteomics. We show that our method can identify much more peptides and proteins, improving the characterization of the proteins expressed in the microbial communities.},

In this study we have used metagenomics to characterize the prokaryotic communities inhabiting the surface sediments in the Troll area in relation to geochemical parameters, particularly related to hydrocarbon presence. We also investigated the possibility of increased potential for methane oxidation related to the pockmarks. Five metagenomes from pockmarks and plain seabed sediments were sequenced by pyrosequencing (Roche/454) technology. In addition, two metagenomes from seabed sediments geologically unlikely to be influenced by hydrocarbon seepage (the Oslofjord) were included. The taxonomic distribution and metabolic potential of the metagenomes were analyzed by multivariate analysis and statistical comparisons to reveal variation within and between the two sampling areas.},

Although metagenomic sequencing indicated that both biofilms were dominated by prokaryotic sequence reads ({\textgreater} 91\%) with the majority of the bacterial reads belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria, the Ship-1 metagenome harbored greater organismal and functional diversity and was comparatively enriched for sequences from Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and macroscopic eukaryotes, whereas the Ship-2 metagenome was enriched for sequences from Proteobacteria and microscopic photosynthetic eukaryotes. Qualitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metaproteome analyses identified 678 unique proteins, revealed little overlap in species and protein composition between the ships and contrasted with the metagenomic data in that {\textasciitilde}80\% of classified and annotated proteins were of eukaryotic origin and dominated by members of the Bacillariophyta, Cnidaria, Chordata and Arthropoda (data deposited to the {ProteomeXchange}, identifier {PXD}000961). Within the shared metaproteome, quantitative (18)O and {iTRAQ} analyses demonstrated a significantly greater abundance of structural proteins from macroscopic eukaryotes on Ship-1 and diatom photosynthesis proteins on Ship-2.

Totally, 1018 non-repeated proteins were identified with the four treatments. On the whole, each treatment could recover the biofilm proteins with specific distributions of molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and isoelectric point. The extraction buffers containing zwitterionic and anionic detergents were found to harvest the proteins with better efficiency and quality, allowing identification up to 76.2\% of total identified proteins with the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} analysis. According to the annotation with a relevant metagenomic database, we further observed different taxonomic profiles of bacterial and archaeal members and discriminable patterns of the functional expression among the extraction buffers used. Overall, the finding of the present study provides first insight to the effect of the detergents on the characteristics of extractable proteins from biofilm and the developed protocol combined with nano 2D-{LC}/{MS}/{MS} analysis can improve the metaproteomics studies on microbial functionality of biofilms in the wastewater treatment systems.},

A decade has passed since the term "metaproteomics" was first coined and corresponding analyses were carried out on mixed microbial communities. Since then metaproteomics has yielded many important insights into microbial ecosystem function in the various environmental settings where it has been applied. Although initial progress in analytical capacities and resulting numbers of proteins identified was extremely fast, this trend slowed rapidly. Here, we discuss several representative metaproteomic investigations of activated sludge, acid mine drainage biofilms, freshwater and seawater microbial communities, soil, and human gut microbiota. By using these case studies, we highlight current challenges and possible solutions for metaproteomics to realize its full potential, i.e. to enable conclusive links between microbial community composition, physiology, function, interactions, ecology, and evolution in situ.},

However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (e.g. proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. While the standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative controls, most small-scale {AP}-{MS} studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait-independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple {AP}-{MS} studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol.

Here, we document a transition from Bacteria- to Archaea-dominated communities in microbial biofilms sampled from the Richmond Mine acid mine drainage ({AMD}) system (∼{pH} 1.0, ∼38°C) and in laboratory-cultivated biofilms. This transition occurs when chemoautotrophic microbial communities that develop at the air-solution interface sink to the sediment-solution interface and degrade under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The archaea identified in these sunken biofilms are from the class Thermoplasmata, and in some cases, the highly divergent {ARMAN} nanoarchaeal lineage. In several of the sunken biofilms, nanoarchaea comprise 10 to 25\% of the community, based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and metagenomic analyses. Comparative community proteomic analyses show a persistence of bacterial proteins in sunken biofilms, but there is clear evidence for amino acid modifications due to acid hydrolysis. Given the low representation of bacterial cells in sunken biofilms based on microscopy, we infer that hydrolysis reflects proteins derived from lysed cells. For archaea, we detected ∼2,400 distinct proteins, including a subset involved in proteolysis and peptide uptake. Laboratory cultivation experiments using complex carbon substrates demonstrated anaerobic enrichment of Ferroplasma and Aplasma coupled to the reduction of ferric iron. These findings indicate dominance of acidophilic archaea in degrading biofilms and suggest that they play roles in anaerobic nutrient cycling at low {pH}.},

This is usually based on the d/l value of a single amino acid, d-alloisoleucine/l-isoleucine (A/I), in the total shell proteins. Two genera of freshwater gastropods (Valvata and Bithynia) are used to explore the value of using multiple amino acids from the intra-crystalline fraction, which should be more protected from the effects of diagenesis than the inter-crystalline component. Results are compared from both the aragonitic shells and opercula composed of calcite, a more stable form of calcium carbonate. In order to put the amino acid data from the West Runton Freshwater Bed into perspective, statistical analyses are used to compare them with results from the Hoxnian ({MIS} 11) site at Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Twelve protein decomposition indicators revealed that the results from the shells were not as clear-cut as those from the opercula. Five indicators from the Valvata shell suggest that West Runton is older than Clacton (at a 95\% significance level), but two actually suggested a younger age. Seven indicators show that the Bithynia shells from West Runton are older than congeneric shells from Clacton. In marked contrast, all 12 indicators isolated from the opercula demonstrate that West Runton is significantly older than Clacton. The data are also compared with results from Waverley Wood, an important archaeological site in the English Midlands falling within the ‘Cromerian Complex’. Contrary to earlier interpretations, the new amino acid data from Bithynia opercula indicate that West Runton is older than Waverley Wood, a relationship now consistent with the available biostratigraphy.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Mass spectrometry has shown itself as the most efficient tool for the sequencing of peptides. However, de novo sequencing of novel natural peptides is significantly more challenging in comparison with the same procedure applied for the tryptic peptides. To reach the goal in this case it is essential to select the most useful methods of triggering fragmentation and combine complementary techniques.
{METHODS}: Comparison of low-energy collision-induced dissociation ({CID}) and higher energy collision-induced dissociation ({HCD}) modes for sequencing of the natural non-tryptic peptides with disulfide bonds and/or several proline residues in the backbone was achieved using an {LTQ} {FT} Ultra Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ({FTICR}) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 7 T magnet and an {LTQ} Orbitrap Velos {ETD} (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) instrument. Peptide fractions were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}) separation of frog skin secretion samples from ten species of Rana temporaria, caught in the Kolomna district of Moscow region (Russia).
{RESULTS}: {HCD} makes the b/y series longer and more pronounced, thus increasing sequence coverage. Fragment ions due to cleavages at the C-termini of proline residues make the sequencing more reliable and may be used to detect missed cleavages in the case of tryptic peptides. Another {HCD} peculiarity involves formation of pronounced inner fragment ions (secondary y(n)b(m) ion series formed from the abundant primary y-ions). Differences in de novo sequencing of natural non-tryptic peptides with {CID} and {HCD}, involving thorough manual expert interpretation of spectra and two automatic sequencing algorithms, are discussed.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although {HCD} provides better results, a combination of {CID} and {HCD} data may notably increase reliability of de novo sequencing. Several pairs of b2 /a2 -ions may be formed in {HCD}, complicating the spectra. Automatic de novo sequencing with the available programs remains less efficient than the manual one, independently of the collision energy.},

The unrecycled fraction of this organic matter can become buried in ocean sediments, thus sequestering carbon and so influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques. Here, using solid-state 13C {NMR} spectroscopy, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Sea. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination or microbial biosynthesis, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

We present new cloud computing functionality for the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a free and open-source suite of tools for the processing and analysis of tandem mass spectrometry datasets. Enabled with Amazon Web Services cloud computing, the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline now accesses large scale computing resources, limited only by the available Amazon Web Services infrastructure, for all users. The Trans-Proteomic Pipeline runs in an environment fully hosted on Amazon Web Services, where all software and data reside on cloud resources to tackle large search studies. In addition, it can also be run on a local computer with computationally intensive tasks launched onto the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service to greatly decrease analysis times. We describe the new Trans-Proteomic Pipeline cloud service components, compare the relative performance and costs of various Elastic Compute Cloud service instance types, and present on-line tutorials that enable users to learn how to deploy cloud computing technology rapidly with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline. We provide tools for estimating the necessary computing resources and costs given the scale of a job and demonstrate the use of cloud enabled Trans-Proteomic Pipeline by performing over 1100 tandem mass spectrometry files through four proteomic search engines in 9 h and at a very low cost.},

	abstract = {Intact proteins comprise a major component of organic carbon and nitrogen produced globally and are likely an important fraction of organic matter in sediments and soils. Extracting the protein component from sediments and soils for mass spectral characterization and identification represents a substantial challenge given the range of products and functionalities present in the complex matrix. Multiple forms of gel electrophoresis were evaluated as a means of enhancing recovery of sedimentary protein before proteomic characterization and compared with a direct enzymatic digestion of proteins in sediments. Resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed using shotgun proteomics and tandem mass spectra were evaluated with {SEQUEST}. Multiple databases were then evaluated to examine the ability to confidently identify proteins from environmental samples. Following evaluation of electrophoretic extraction of proteins from sediments, the recovery of an experimentally added standard protein ({BSA}) from older ({\textgreater}1 ky) sediments was optimized. Protein extraction from sediments via direct electrophoresis of a slurry mixture and the specified extraction buffer resulted in the greatest number of confident protein identifications and highest sequence coverage of the {BSA} standard. Searching tandem mass spectral data against larger databases with a higher diversity of proteomes did not yield a greater number of, or more confidence in, protein identifications. Regardless of the protein database used, identified peptides correlated to proteins with the same function across taxa. This suggests that while determining taxonomic-level information remains a challenge in samples with unknown mixed species, it is possible to confidently assign the function of the identified protein.},

This study investigated the diversity of {OMZ} protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({\textgreater}30 and 30-1.6 μm filters) from the world's largest permanent {OMZ} in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina {MiSeq} sequencing of V4 region of 18S {SSU} {rRNA} genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic waters shared only ∼32\% of operational taxonomic unit ({OTU}) (97\% sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7\% of total {OTUs} were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6-30 μm fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

Bacterial biomass was about equal to phytoplankton biomass during all

growth efficiency of 50\%, we estimate that heterotrophic bacteria
consumed 10\% (June 1987) to 24\% (August 1988) of primary production in
the euphotic zone. These percentages are low compared with other aquatic
ecosystems, apparently due to low bacterial growth rates ({\textless}0.1 day
-1) iin the subarctic Pacific. In contrast, phytoplankton
growth rates were much higher (0.1-8.8 day -1). Bacterial
growth rates were limited by the supply of dissolved organic matter and
temperature. Even with these low growth rates, however, bacterial
biomass and rates of biomass production increased by 2-5-fold in May and
August 1988, changes that were not obviously related to corresponding
changes in phytoplankton biomass nor primary production. Heterotrophic
bacterioplankton constitutes a large reservoir of carbon and nitrogen

The emphasis is on chemical studies but, in keeping with the growing interdisciplinary nature of marine science, advances in other disciplines are also discussed, particularly those in biological sciences. Increasing evidence for the importance of picoplankton, bacteria and viruses as {POM} constituents is highlighted, including the recent recognition of large populations of autotrophic bacteria able to harvest light for energy. The transport of {POM} to bottom waters was thought to be largely confined to large, rapidly sinking faecal pellets. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of organic aggregates and flocs formed by diatoms such as Rhizosolenia and other microalgae. Ascending particles have also been discovered, many of which are lipid-rich. Several studies have shown that resuspension of bottom sediments and lateral advection of material from continental shelves can lead to anomalously high particle fluxes measured in sediment traps moored in deep water. Many new approaches for characterizing {POM} have emerged, such as pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry for analysis of higher molecular weight materials and biopolymers. Lipid biomarker techniques have also advanced, exciting new possibilities being raised by the ability to measure stable and radioactive carbon isotopes for individual compounds. The techniques of molecular biology, such as the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), are being increasingly applied to provide complementary information to more conventional microscopy and flow cytometry on the identity of organisms in the sea. The combination of these techniques with advanced chemical analysis methods promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the origins, transport and fate of organic matter in the oceans.},

New interdisciplinary approaches are needed to move from this descriptive level to improved quantitative, process‐level understanding of the roles of marine microbes in biogeochemical cycles and of the impact of environmental change on the marine microbial ecosystem. Linking studies at levels from the genome to the organism, to ecological strategies and organism and ecosystem response, requires new modelling approaches. Key to this will be a fundamental shift in modelling scale that represents micro‐organisms from the level of their macromolecular components. This will enable contact with omics data sets and allow acclimation and adaptive response at the phenotype level (i.e. traits) to be simulated as a combination of fitness maximization and evolutionary constraints. This way forward will build on ecological approaches that identify key organism traits and systems biology approaches that integrate traditional physiological measurements with new insights from omics. It will rely on developing an improved understanding of ecophysiology to understand quantitatively environmental controls on microbial growth strategies. It will also incorporate results from experimental evolution studies in the representation of adaptation. The resulting ecosystem‐level models can then evaluate our level of understanding of controls on ecosystem structure and function, highlight major gaps in understanding and help prioritize areas for future research programs. Ultimately, this grand synthesis should improve predictive capability of the ecosystem response to multiple environmental drivers.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.3389/fmicb.2017.00057},
	abstract = {Despite their potential importance as analogs of primitive microbial metabolisms, the knowledge of the structure and functioning of the deep ecosystems associated with serpentinizing environments is hampered by the lack of accessibility to relevant systems. These hyperalkaline environments are depleted in dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), making the carbon sources and assimilation pathways in the associated ecosystems highly enigmatic. The Prony Bay Hydrothermal Field ({PHF}) is an active serpentinization site where, similar to Lost City (Mid-Atlantic Ridge), high-{pH} fluids rich in H2 and {CH}4 are discharged from carbonate chimneys at the seafloor, but in a shallower lagoonal environment. This study aimed to characterize the subsurface microbial ecology of this environment by focusing on the earliest stages of chimney construction, dominated by the discharge of hydrothermal fluids of subseafloor origin. By jointly examining the mineralogy and the microbial diversity of the conduits of juvenile edifices at the micrometric scale, we find a central role of uncultivated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes in the ecology of the {PHF}. These bacteria, along with members of the phyla Acetothermia and Omnitrophica, are identified as the first chimneys inhabitants before archaeal Methanosarcinales. They are involved in the construction and early consolidation of the carbonate structures via organomineralization processes. Their predominance in the most juvenile and nascent hydrothermal chimneys, and their affiliation with environmental subsurface microorganisms, indicate that they are likely discharged with hydrothermal fluids from the subseafloor. They may thus be representative of endolithic serpentinization-based ecosystems, in an environment where {DIC} is limited. In contrast, heterotrophic and fermentative microorganisms may consume organic compounds from the abiotic by-products of serpentinization processes and/or from life in the deeper subsurface. We thus propose that the Firmicutes identified at {PHF} may have a versatile metabolism with the capability to use diverse organic compounds from biological or abiotic origin. From that perspective, this study sheds new light on the structure of deep microbial communities living at the energetic edge in serpentinites and may provide an alternative model of the earliest metabolisms.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic marine bacterioplankton are a critical component of the carbon cycle, processing nearly a quarter of annual primary production, yet defining how substrate utilization preferences and resource partitioning structure microbial communities remains a challenge. In this study, proteomic stable isotope probing (proteomic {SIP}) was used to characterize population-specific assimilation of dissolved free amino acids ({DFAAs}), a major source of dissolved organic carbon for bacterial secondary production in aquatic environments. Microcosms of seawater collected from Newport, Oregon, and Monterey Bay, California, were incubated with 1 µM 13C-labeled amino acids for 15 and 32 h. The taxonomic compositions of microcosm metaproteomes were highly similar to those of the sampled natural communities, with Rhodobacteriales, {SAR}11, and Flavobacteriales representing the dominant taxa. Analysis of 13C incorporation into protein biomass allowed for quantification of the isotopic enrichment of identified proteins and subsequent determination of differential amino acid assimilation patterns between specific bacterioplankton populations. Proteins associated with Rhodobacterales tended to have a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, opposite the trend for Flavobacteriales and {SAR}11 proteins. Rhodobacterales proteins associated with amino acid transport and metabolism had an increased frequency of 13C-enriched spectra at time point 2. Alteromonadales proteins also had a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, particularly within ribosomal proteins, demonstrating their rapid growth during incubations. Overall, proteomic {SIP} facilitated quantitative comparisons of {DFAA} assimilation by specific taxa, both between sympatric populations and between protein functional groups within discrete populations, allowing an unprecedented examination of population level metabolic responses to resource acquisition in complex microbial communities.
{IMPORTANCE} An estimated 50 gigatons of carbon is annually fixed within marine systems, of which heterotrophic microbial populations process nearly half. These communities vary in composition and activity across spatial and temporal scales, so understanding how these changes affect global processes requires the delineation of functional roles for individual members. In a step toward ascertaining these roles, we applied proteomic stable isotope probing to quantify the assimilation of organic carbon from {DFAAs} into microbial protein biomass, since the turnover of {DFAAs} accounts for a substantial fraction of marine microbial carbon metabolism that is directed into biomass production. We conducted experiments at two coastal North Pacific locations and found taxonomically distinct responses. This approach allowed us to compare amino acid assimilation by specific bacterioplankton populations and characterize their allocation of this substrate among cellular functions.},

Large differences in individual particle colonization could be detected.

Different particle kinds (diatomaceous earth, sand, chitin and cellulose) were colonized by very different communities of bacteria belonging to Roseobacter, Vibrio, Bacteriovorax, and Lacinutrix that were distant relatives of genomes already described from marine habitats. Besides, using assembly from deep metagenomic sequencing from the particle-specific enrichments we were able to determine a total of 20 groups of contigs (eight of them with {\textgreater}50\% completeness) and reconstruct de novo five new genomes of novel species within marine clades ({\textgreater}79\% completeness and {\textless}1.8\% contamination). We also describe for the first time the genome of a marine Rhizobiales phage that seems to infect a broad range of Alphaproteobacteria and live in habitats as diverse as soil, marine sediment and water column. The metagenomic recruitment of the communities found by direct sequencing of the large size filter and by enrichment had nearly no overlap. These results indicate that these reconstructed genomes are part of the rare biosphere which exists at nominal levels under natural conditions.},

We determined the phylogenetic affiliation for the microorganisms growing on aggregates by pyrosequencing partial 16S {rRNA} gene amplicons. Water column samples were also collected and sequenced for comparison between sinking-particle-associated and planktonic bacterial communities. Statistically significant differences were found between the water column and sediment trap bacteria. Relative abundances of Pelagibacter sp. and multiple members of the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, and α-Proteobacteria were elevated in water column samples, while trap samples contained members of the Roseobacter clade of α-Proteobacteria in high relative abundances. Our findings indicated that rapid changes – within 24 h of collection – occurred to the microbial community associated with aggregates from either bloom type. There was a little change in the bacterial assemblage after the initial 24-h incubation period. The most abundant early colonizer was a Sulfitobacter sp. This study provides further evidence that Roseobacters are rapid colonizers of marine aggregates and that colonization can occur on short timescales. This study further demonstrates that particle origin may be insignificant regarding the heterotrophic bacterial population that degrades them.},

The first sequenced genomes of marine Bacteroidetes seemed to confirm this assumption. Many more genomes have been sequenced recently. Here, a comparative analysis of marine Bacteroidetes genomes revealed a life strategy different from those of other important phyla of marine bacterioplankton such as Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes have many adaptations to grow attached to particles, have the capacity to degrade polymers, including a large number of peptidases, glycoside hydrolases ({GHs}), glycosyl transferases, adhesion proteins, as well as the genes for gliding motility. Several of the polymer degradation genes are located in close association with genes for {TonB}-dependent receptors and transducers, suggesting an integrated regulation of adhesion and degradation of polymers. This confirmed the role of this abundant group of marine bacteria as degraders of particulate matter. Marine Bacteroidetes had a significantly larger number of proteases than {GHs}, while non-marine Bacteroidetes had equal numbers of both. Proteorhodopsin containing Bacteroidetes shared two characteristics: small genome size and a higher number of genes involved in {CO}2 fixation per Mb. The latter may be important in order to survive when floating freely in the illuminated, but nutrient-poor, ocean surface.},

In this study, we used particle interceptor traps ({PITs}) to assess the nature of particle-associated microbial communities collected at a variety of depths in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Comparative metagenomics was used to assess differences in microbial taxa and functional gene repertoires in {PITs} containing a preservative (poisoned traps) compared to preservative-free traps where growth was allowed to continue in situ (live traps). Live trap microbial communities shared taxonomic and functional similarities with bacteria previously reported to be enriched in dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) microcosms (e.g., Alteromonas and Methylophaga), in addition to other particle and eukaryote-associated bacteria (e.g., Flavobacteriales and Pseudoalteromonas). Poisoned trap microbial assemblages were enriched in Vibrio and Campylobacterales likely associated with eukaryotic surfaces and intestinal tracts as symbionts, pathogens, or saprophytes. The functional gene content of microbial assemblages in poisoned traps included a variety of genes involved in virulence, anaerobic metabolism, attachment to chitinaceaous surfaces, and chitin degradation. The presence of chitinaceaous surfaces was also accompanied by the co-existence of bacteria which encoded the capacity to attach to, transport and metabolize chitin and its derivatives. Distinctly different microbial assemblages predominated in live traps, which were largely represented by copiotrophs and eukaryote-associated bacterial communities. Predominant sediment trap-assocaited eukaryotic phyla included Dinoflagellata, Metazoa (mostly copepods), Protalveolata, Retaria, and Stramenopiles. These data indicate the central role of eukaryotic taxa in structuring sinking particle microbial assemblages, as well as the rapid responses of indigenous microbial species in the degradation of marine particulate organic matter ({POM}) in situ in the ocean's interior.},

The increase in δ18O is up to 3‰ greater than in δ15N, whereas our experiments with denitrifier cultures in seawater medium indicate a 1:1 increase in {NO}3− δ18O and δ15N during {NO}3− consumption. Moreover, the maximum in {NO}3− δ18O is somewhat shallower than the maximum in {NO}3− δ15N. These two observations can be summarized as an “anomaly” from the 1:1 δ18O-to-δ15N relationship expected from culture results. Comparison among stations and with other data indicates that this anomaly is generated locally. The anomaly has two plausible interpretations: (1) the addition of low-δ15N {NO}3− to the shallow thermocline by the remineralization of newly fixed nitrogen, or (2) active cycling between {NO}3− and {NO}2− (coupled {NO}3− reduction and {NO}2− oxidation) in the suboxic zone.},

The measured fractionations during sulfate reduction could explain only between 41\% and 85\% of the 34S depletion in the sedimentary sulfides. This result directly demonstrates that the depletion of 34S in solid sulfides is an expression of the combined activity of sulfate-reducing organisms with additional fractionations accumulated during the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle. The only known process to significantly augment the fractionations created during sulfate reduction is the microbial disproportionation of the intermediate sulfur compounds: elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, and sulfite. In a simple model, we show how important each of these disproportionation processes could be in generating the isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfides. The sulfate reduction rates in the sediments studied varied by a factor of 1000 and did not correlate with the fractionation during sulfate reduction. By contrast, a correlation was observed between sulfate- reduction rate and the extent of 34S depletion into sedimentary sulfides, the most 34S-depleted sulfides found in sediments supporting the lowest rates of sulfate reduction. Thus, the fractionations imposed during the disproportionating processes are better expressed in sediments with low sulfate-reduction rates. The direct phototrophic oxidation of sulfide to sulfate, with minimal fractionation, may have been important in the sediments that had a high sulfate-reduction rate.},

	abstract = {Sulfur isotopes in the geological record integrate a combination of biological and diagenetic influences, but a key control on the ratio of sulfur isotopes in sedimentary materials is the magnitude of isotope fractionation imparted during dissimilatory sulfate reduction. This fractionation is controlled by the flux of sulfur through the network of chemical reactions involved in sulfate reduction and by the isotope effect associated with each of these chemical reactions. Despite its importance, the network of reactions constituting sulfate reduction is not fully understood, with two principle networks underpinning most isotope models. In this study, we build on biochemical data and recently solved crystal structures of enzymes to propose a revised network topology for the flow of sulfur through the sulfate reduction metabolism. This network is highly branched and under certain conditions produces results consistent with the observations that motivated previous sulfate reduction models. Our revised network suggests that there are two main paths to sulfide production: one that involves the production of thionate intermediates, and one that does not. We suggest that a key factor in determining sulfur isotope fractionation associated with sulfate reduction is the ratio of the rate at which electrons are supplied to subunits of Dsr vs. the rate of sulfite delivery to the active site of Dsr. This reaction network may help geochemists to better understand the relationship between the physiology of sulfate reduction and the isotopic record it produces.},

Newly developed {PCR} assays allowed the amplification of 92-93 \% (2.1-2.3 kb) of the {APS} reductase locus {aprBA}. {PCR}-based screening of 116 taxonomically divergent {SOP} reference strains revealed a distribution of {aprBA} restricted to photo- and chemotrophs with strict anaerobic or at least facultative anaerobic lifestyles, including Chlorobiaceae, Chromatiaceae, Thiobacillus, Thiothrix and invertebrate symbionts. In the {AprBA}-based tree, the {SOP} diverge into two distantly related phylogenetic lineages, Apr lineages I and {II}, with the proteins of lineage {II} (Chlorobiaceae and others) in closer affiliation to the enzymes of the sulfate-reducing prokaryotes ({SRP}). This clustering is discordant with the dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({DsrAB}) phylogeny and indicates putative lateral {aprBA} gene transfer from {SRP} to the respective {SOB} lineages. In support of lateral gene transfer ({LGT}), several beta- and gammaproteobacterial species harbour both {aprBA} homologues, the {DsrAB}-congruent 'authentic' and the {SRP}-related, {LGT}-derived gene loci, while some relatives possess exclusively the {SRP}-related apr genes as a possible result of resident gene displacement by the xenologue. The two-gene state might be an intermediate in the replacement of the resident essential gene. Collected genome data demonstrate the correlation between the {AprBA} tree topology and the composition/arrangement of the apr gene loci (occurrence of {qmoABC} or {aprM} genes) from {SRP} and {SOP} of lineages I and {II}.

Subsequent heterotrophic decomposition of the produced biomass increases the oxygen-depletion at intermediate water depths, which can result in the formation of oxygen minimum zones ({OMZ}). {OMZs} can sporadically accumulate hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is toxic to most multicellular organisms and has been implicated in massive fish kills. During a cruise to the {OMZ} off Peru in January 2009 we found a sulfidic plume in continental shelf waters, covering an area {\textgreater}5500 km2, which contained ∼2.2×104 tons of H2S. This was the first time that H2S was measured in the Peruvian {OMZ} and with ∼440 km3 the largest plume ever reported for oceanic waters. We assessed the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the inhabiting microbial community by high-throughput sequencing of {DNA} and {RNA}, while its metabolic activity was determined with rate measurements of carbon fixation and nitrogen transformation processes. The waters were dominated by several distinct γ-, δ- and ε-proteobacterial taxa associated with either sulfur oxidation or sulfate reduction. Our results suggest that these chemolithoautotrophic bacteria utilized several oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) to detoxify the sulfidic waters well below the oxic surface. The chemolithoautotrophic activity at our sampling site led to high rates of dark carbon fixation. Assuming that these chemolithoautotrophic rates were maintained throughout the sulfidic waters, they could be representing as much as ∼30\% of the photoautotrophic carbon fixation. Postulated changes such as eutrophication and global warming, which lead to an expansion and intensification of {OMZs}, might also increase the frequency of sulfidic waters. We suggest that the chemolithoautotrophically fixed carbon may be involved in a negative feedback loop that could fuel further sulfate reduction and potentially stabilize the sulfidic {OMZ} waters.},

	abstract = {The biogeochemical cycling in oxygen-minimum zones ({OMZs}) is dominated by the interactions of microbial nitrogen transformations and, as recently observed in the Chilean upwelling system, also through the energetically less favorable remineralization of sulfate reduction. The latter process is masked, however, by rapid sulfide oxidation, most likely through nitrate reduction. Thus, the cryptic sulfur cycle links with the nitrogen cycle in {OMZ} settings. Here, we model the physical-chemical water column structure and the observed process rates as driven by formation and sinking of organic detritus, to quantify the nitrogen and sulfur cycles in the Chilean {OMZ}. A new biogeochemical submodule was developed and coupled to the Regional Ocean Model System ({ROMS}). The model results generally agree with the observed distribution of reactive species and the measured process rates. Modeled heterotrophic nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction are responsible for 47\% and 36\%, respectively, of organic remineralization in a 150 m deep zone below mixed layer. Anammox contributes to 61\% of the fixed nitrogen lost to N2 gas, while the rest of the loss is through canonical denitrification as a combination of organic matter oxidation by nitrite reduction and sulfide-driven denitrification. Mineralization coupled to heterotrophic nitrate reduction supplies {\textasciitilde}48\% of the ammonium required by anammox. Due to active sulfate reduction, model results suggest that sulfide-driven denitrification contributes to 36\% of the nitrogen loss as N2 gas. Our model results highlight the importance of considering the coupled nitrogen and sulfur cycle in examining open-ocean anoxic processes under present, past, and future conditions.},

The recent identification of anammox, instead of denitrification, as the likely prevalent pathway for nitrogen loss in this {OMZ} raises strong questions about our understanding of nitrogen cycling and organic matter remineralization in these waters. Without detectable denitrification, it is unclear how {NH}4+ is remineralized from organic matter and sustains anammox or how secondary {NO}2− maxima arise within the {OMZ}. Here we show that in the {ETSP}-{OMZ}, anammox obtains 67\% or more of {NO}2− from nitrate reduction, and 33\% or less from aerobic ammonia oxidation, based on stable-isotope pairing experiments corroborated by functional gene expression analyses. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium was detected in an open-ocean setting. It occurred throughout the {OMZ} and could satisfy a substantial part of the {NH}4+ requirement for anammox. The remaining {NH}4+ came from remineralization via nitrate reduction and probably from microaerobic respiration. Altogether, deep-sea {NO}3− accounted for only ≈50\% of the nitrogen loss in the {ETSP}, rather than 100\% as commonly assumed. Because oceanic {OMZs} seem to be expanding because of global climate change, it is increasingly imperative to incorporate the correct nitrogen-loss pathways in global biogeochemical models to predict more accurately how the nitrogen cycle in our future ocean may respond.},

	abstract = {A major impediment to understanding long-term changes in the marine nitrogen (N) cycle is the persistent uncertainty about the rates, distribution, and sensitivity of its largest fluxes in the modern ocean. We use a global ocean circulation model to obtain the first 3-D estimate of marine denitrification rates that is maximally consistent with available observations of nitrate deficits and the nitrogen isotopic ratio of oceanic nitrate. We find a global rate of marine denitrification in suboxic waters and sediments of 120–240 Tg N yr−1, which is lower than many other recent estimates. The difference stems from the ability to represent the 3-D spatial structure of suboxic zones, where denitrification rates of 50–77 Tg N yr−1 result in up to 50\% depletion of nitrate. This depletion reduces the effect of local isotopic enrichment on the rest of the ocean, allowing the N isotope ratio of oceanic nitrate to be achieved with a sedimentary denitrification rate about 1.3–2.3 times that of suboxic zones. This balance of N losses between sediments and suboxic zones is shown to obey a simple relationship between isotope fractionation and the degree of nitrate consumption in the core of the suboxic zones. The global denitrification rates derived here suggest that the marine nitrogen budget is likely close to balanced.},

	abstract = {Primary production in over half of the world's oceans is limited by fixed nitrogen availability. The main loss term from the fixed nitrogen inventory is the production of dinitrogen gas (N2) by heterotrophic denitrification or the more recently discovered autotrophic process, anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Oceanic oxygen minimum zones ({OMZ}) are responsible for about 35\% of oceanic N2 production and up to half of that occurs in the Arabian Sea. Although denitrification was long thought to be the only loss term, it has recently been argued that anammox alone is responsible for fixed nitrogen loss in the {OMZs}. Here we measure denitrification and anammox rates and quantify the abundance of denitrifying and anammox bacteria in the {OMZ} regions of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and the Arabian Sea. We find that denitrification rather than anammox dominates the N2 loss term in the Arabian Sea, the largest and most intense {OMZ} in the world ocean. In seven of eight experiments in the Arabian Sea denitrification is responsible for 87–99\% of the total N2 production. The dominance of denitrification is reproducible using two independent isotope incubation methods. In contrast, anammox is dominant in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific {OMZ}, as detected using one of the isotope incubation methods, as previously reported. The abundance of denitrifying bacteria always exceeded that of anammox bacteria by up to 7- and 19-fold in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and Arabian Sea, respectively. Geographic and temporal variability in carbon supply may be responsible for the different contributions of denitrification and anammox in these two {OMZs}. The large contribution of denitrification to N2 loss in the Arabian Sea indicates the global significance of denitrification to the oceanic nitrogen budget.},

Fractionations were unaffected by changes in sulfate concentration between 2 {mM} and 28 {mM}. After the natural substrate was exhausted, the sulfate-reducing bacterial population metabolized, in turn, with acetate, ethanol, and lactate. The high fractionations encountered with natural substrate were only reproduced when the amended substrate was supplied at concentrations limiting the activity of the sulfate-reducing population. Higher, nonlimiting concentrations of amended substrate produced lower fractionations of 16‰ to 21\% at 25°C. The natural sulfate-reducing population, therefore, probably experienced substrate limitation while utilizing the natural substrate. At the low temperature of 5°C fractionations with amended substrate ranged from 8‰ to 14‰ and were lower than expected based on the normal relationship between rates of sulfate reduction and the extent of isotope fractionation. The processes likely acting to control the magnitude of isotope fractionation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Phanerozoic levels of atmospheric oxygen relate to the burial histories of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur. The sulfur cycle remains poorly constrained, however, leading to concomitant uncertainties in O2 budgets. Here we present experiments linking the magnitude of fractionations of the multiple sulfur isotopes to the rate of microbial sulfate reduction. The data demonstrate that such fractionations are controlled by the availability of electron donor (organic matter), rather than by the concentration of electron acceptor (sulfate), an environmental constraint that varies among sedimentary burial environments. By coupling these results with a sediment biogeochemical model of pyrite burial, we find a strong relationship between observed sulfur isotope fractionations over the last 200 Ma and the areal extent of shallow seafloor environments. We interpret this as a global dependency of the rate of microbial sulfate reduction on the availability of organic-rich sea-floor settings. However, fractionation during the early/mid-Paleozoic fails to correlate with shelf area. We suggest that this decoupling reflects a shallower paleoredox boundary, primarily confined to the water column in the early Phanerozoic. The transition between these two states begins during the Carboniferous and concludes approximately around the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, indicating a prolonged response to a Carboniferous rise in O2. Together, these results lay the foundation for decoupling changes in sulfate reduction rates from the global average record of pyrite burial, highlighting how the local nature of sedimentary processes affects global records. This distinction greatly refines our understanding of the S cycle and its relationship to the history of atmospheric oxygen.},

In almost all sites studied sulfate is depleted with depth, through both organic matter oxidation and anaerobic methane oxidation. The δ18OSO4 increases rapidly near the top of the sediments, from seawater values of 9 to maxima between 22 and 25, and remains isotopically heavy and constant at these values with depth. The δ18OSO4 in these pore fluid profiles is decoupled from variations in sulfur isotopes measured on the same sulfate samples (δ34SSO4); the δ34SSO4 increases continuously with depth and exhibits a shallower isotopic increase. This isotopic decoupling between the δ34SSO4 and the δ18OSO4 is hard to reconcile with the traditional understanding of bacterial sulfate reduction in sediments. Our data support the idea that sulfate or sulfite and water isotopically exchange during sulfate reduction and that some of the isotopically altered sulfur pool returns to the environment. We calculate that the rapid increase in the δ18OSO4 in the upper part of these sediments requires rates of this oxygen isotope exchange that are several orders of magnitude higher than the rates of net sulfate reduction calculated from the sulfate concentration profiles and supported by the δ34SSO4. We suggest several mechanisms by which this may occur, including ‘net-zero’ sulfur cycling, as well as further experiments through which we can test and resolve these processes.},

	abstract = {The information encoded by the two stable isotope systems in sulfate ( δ 34 S {SO} 4 and δ 18 O {SO} 4 ) has been widely applied to aid reconstructions of both modern and ancient environments. Interpretation of δ 18 O {SO} 4 records has been complicated by rapid oxygen isotope equilibration between sulfoxyanions and water. Specifically, the apparent relationship that develops between δ 18 O {SO} 4 and δ18Owater during microbial sulfate reduction is thought to result from rapid oxygen isotope equilibrium between intracellular water and aqueous sulfite – a reactive intermediate of the sulfate reduction network that can back-react to produce sulfate. Here, we describe the oxygen equilibrium isotope effect between water and sulfite (referring to all the sum of all S({IV})-oxyanions including sulfite and both isomers and the dimer of bisulfite). Based on experiments conducted over a range of {pH} (4.5–9.8) and temperature (2–95 °C), where ε = 1000 * (α − 1), we find ε {SO} 3 – H 2 O = 13.61 - 0.299 ∗ {pH} - 0.081 ∗ T ° C.

Thus, at a {pH} (7.0) and temperature (25 °C) typifying commonly used experimental conditions for sulfate reducing bacterial cultures, sulfite is enriched in 18O by 9.5‰ (±0.8‰) relative to ambient water.

We examine the implication of these results in a sulfate reduction network that has been revised to reflect our understanding of the reactions involving oxygen. By evaluating previously published data within this new architecture, our results are consistent with previous suggestions of high reversibility of the sulfate reduction biochemical network. We also demonstrate that intracellular exchange rates between {SO} 3 2 - and water must be on average 1–3 orders of magnitude more rapid than intracellular fluxes of sulfate reduction intermediates and that kinetic isotope effects upstream of {SO} 3 2 - are required to explain previous laboratory and environmental studies of δ 18 O {SO} 4 resulting as a consequence of sulfate reduction.},

Microcosms with {FeS} as a substrate also showed growth at the {OATZ} and subsequent dilution series resulted in the isolation of three novel strains, of which strain J10 grows chemolithoautotrophically with reduced sulfur compounds under microaerobic conditions. All three strains are motile spirilla with bipolar flagella, related to the genera Magnetospirillum and Dechlorospirillum within the Alphaproteobacteria. Strain J10 is closely related to Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense and is the first strain in this genus found to be capable of autotrophic growth. Thiosulfate was oxidized completely to sulfate, with a yield of 4 g protein mol(-1) thiosulfate, and autotrophic growth was evidenced by incorporation of (13)C derived from bicarbonate into biomass. A putative gene encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase type {II} was identified in strain J10, suggesting that the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle is used for autotrophic growth. Analogous genes are also present in other magnetospirilla, and in the autotrophically growing alphaproteobacterium magnetic vibrio {MV}-1.},

This fractionation is controlled by the flux of sulfur through the network of chemical reactions involved in sulfate reduction and by the isotope effect associated with each of these chemical reactions. Despite its importance, the network of reactions constituting sulfate reduction is not fully understood, with two principle networks underpinning most isotope models. In this study, we build on biochemical data and recently solved crystal structures of enzymes to propose a revised network topology for the flow of sulfur through the sulfate reduction metabolism. This network is highly branched and under certain conditions produces results consistent with the observations that motivated previous sulfate reduction models. Our revised network suggests that there are two main paths to sulfide production: one that involves the production of thionate intermediates, and one that does not. We suggest that a key factor in determining sulfur isotope fractionation associated with sulfate reduction is the ratio of the rate at which electrons are supplied to subunits of Dsr vs. the rate of sulfite delivery to the active site of Dsr. This reaction network may help geochemists to better understand the relationship between the physiology of sulfate reduction and the isotopic record it produces.},

During the dissimilatory reduction of {SO}32−, H2S was depleted in 34S by 6‰, and during the reduction of S2O32− to H2S, depletions were between 7‰ and 11‰. The largest observed isotope fractionation was associated with the bacterial disproportionation of {SO}32− which caused a 34S depletion in H2S of 20–37‰ and a 34S enrichment in sulfate of 7–12‰. During the bacterial disproportionation of S2O32−, isotope fractionations between the outer sulfane sulfur and H2S and between the inner sulfonate sulfur and {SO}42− were \&lt;4‰. We observed isotope exchange between the two sulfur atoms of S2O32− leading to a depletion of34S in H2S by up to 12‰ with a comparable enrichment of 34S in {SO}42−. No isotope fractionation was associated with the anoxygenic phototrophic oxidation of H2S to S2O32−. The depletion of 34S into H2S during the bacterial reduction and disproportionation of S2O32− and {SO}32− may, in addition to sulfate reduction and the bacterial disproportionation of elemental sulfur, contribute to the generation of 34S-depleted sedimentary sulfides.},

Only recently, however, have sulfur isotope data from Precambrian rocks begun to emerge that clearly demonstrate sulfate-reducing microbes had evolved by the early Archean. The large spread of δ34S values of microscopic pyrites aligned along growth faces of former gypsum crystals in the ∼3.47-Ga North Pole barite deposit of northwestern Australia provide the oldest evidence of microbial sulfate reduction and the earliest indication of a specific microbial metabolism. The distinct expression of microbial sulfate reduction in this localized and cool sulfate-rich environment provides the oldest date for calibrating the temporal progress of early evolution on the Tree of Life.},

	abstract = {Cryptic sulfur cycling is an enigmatic process in which sulfate is reduced to some lower-valence state sulfur species and subsequently quantitatively reoxidized; the rate and microbial energetics of this process and how prevalent it may be in the environment remain controversial. Here we investigate sulfur cycling in salt marsh sediments from Norfolk, England where we observe high ferrous iron concentrations with no depletion of sulfate or change in the sulfur isotope ratio of that sulfate, but a 5‰ increase in the oxygen isotope ratio in sulfate, indicating that sulfate has been through a reductive cycle replacing its oxygen atoms. This cryptic sulfur cycle was replicated in laboratory incubations using 18O-enriched water, demonstrating that the field results do not solely result from mixing processes in the natural environment. Numerical modeling of the laboratory incubations scaled to represent the salt marsh sediments suggests that the uptake rate of sulfate during this cryptic sulfur cycling is similar to the uptake rate of sulfate during the fastest microbial sulfate reduction that has been measured in the natural environment. The difference is that during cryptic sulfur cycling, all of the sulfur is subsequently reoxidized to sulfate. We discuss mechanisms for this pathway of sulfur cycling including the possible link to the subsurface iron cycle.},

	abstract = {The sulfur biogeochemical cycle integrates the metabolic activity of multiple microbial pathways (e.g., sulfate reduction, disproportionation, and sulfide oxidation) along with abiotic reactions and geological processes that cycle sulfur through various reservoirs. The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth's exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time δ34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

Apparent imbalances in geochemical nitrogen budgets have spurred numerous studies to measure the contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic N2-producing metabolisms (denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation, respectively). Recently, /`cryptic/' sulphur cycling was proposed as a partial solution to the fundamental biogeochemical problem of closing marine fixed-nitrogen budgets in intensely oxygen-deficient regions. The degree to which the cryptic sulphur cycle can fuel a loss of fixed nitrogen in the modern ocean requires the quantification of sulphur recycling in {OMZ} settings. Here we provide a new constraint for {OMZ} sulphate reduction based on isotopic profiles of oxygen (18O/16O) and sulphur (33S/32S, 34S/32S) in seawater sulphate through oxygenated open-ocean and {OMZ}-bearing water columns. When coupled with observations and models of sulphate isotope dynamics and data-constrained model estimates of {OMZ} water-mass residence time, we find that previous estimates for sulphur-driven remineralization and loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans are near the upper limit for what is possible given in situ sulphate isotope data.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of sulfur (δ34S) and oxygen (δ18O) in marine sulfate respond to changes in fluxes and processes in the global sulfur cycle. The two isotope systems respond on different time scales to different factors affecting the global sulfur cycle. Sulfur isotopes respond primarily to the relative fluxes of weathering-derived sulfate to the oceans versus the net flux of sulfur exported from the oceans as pyrite in marine sediments. At the present day, this response is relatively slow (∼ 20 Ma) because of the large size of the marine sulfate reservoir; ancient oceans had lower sulfate concentrations and thus sulfate residence times may have been shorter. The δ34S of marine sulfate is also sensitive to the development of a significant reservoir of H2S in ancient stratified oceans. Sulfate–oxygen isotopes respond primarily to changes in the cycling of sulfur in the oceans and marine sediments. Sulfur disproportionation, oxic and anaerobic sulfide oxidation all impart different δ18O signatures to marine sulfate; the relative importance of these different processes is in turn controlled by the distribution of redox conditions and microbial ecology of sea-floor sediments. The mutual interpretation of changes in marine sulfate δ34S and δ18O can thus give rather precise information on the nature of changes in global sulfur cycling. Recently, records of isotope compositions of ancient marine sulfate have become available through the analysis of carbonate-associated sulfate ({CAS}) in limestones and marine biogenic barite, both of which provide far more continuous records than previous data based primarily on marine evaporite sulfate minerals.

We review a number of case studies which use sulfur or combined sulfur and oxygen isotopic records derived from {CAS} and biogenic barite. Proterozoic {CAS}-sulfur isotope datasets often show marked variations over very small stratigraphic intervals (e.g. 20‰ over 300 m). When examined in conjunction with estimates of deposition rates, they are used to infer a new evolutionary curve of marine sulfate concentrations and therefore a protracted oxidation of the Earth's biosphere. Through the Cretaceous–Tertiary interval, the marine sulfate–sulfur record is characterised by significant periods of relative stability punctuated by phases of more rapid change (limited to 7‰ variation over the last 130 Ma). The Carboniferous was characterized essentially by a gradual change of 9‰ over 60 Ma. By contrast, at the Permian–Triassic boundary, extreme changes occur over very short geological time scales (14‰ over \&lt; 1 Ma); simple mass balance considerations suggest the development of a large, relatively short-lived, reservoir of H2S in the oceanic water column at this time. In this case, it is the short time scale of the response of the sulfate–oxygen record that enables the interpretation of rapid changes in oceanic redox state. Over the last 10 Ma, sulfate–oxygen δ18O in biogenic barite exhibits large isotope changes (∼ 7‰) that occur independently of those in sulfate–sulfur. These changes must reflect changes in depositional/redox environment at the ocean margins and/or changes in microbial cycling of sulfur, but the exact cause remains controversial. Our limited understanding of the influence of redox environment and sediment microbial ecology on sulfur cycling currently restricts the level to which we are able to interpret such changes in marine sulfate δ18O.},

With these values, we use a box-model to place constraints on the gross fraction of pyrite burial in modern sediments. This model presents an improvement on previous estimates of the global pyrite burial flux because it does not rely on the assumed value of δ 34 S pyrite , which is poorly constrained, but instead uses new information about the relationship between δ 34 S and δ 33 S in global marine sulfate. Our calculations indicate that the pyrite burial flux from the modern ocean is between 10\% and 45\% of the total sulfur lost from the oceans, with a more probable range between 20\% and 35\%.},

While these bacteria are closely related, they have varied ecological lifestyles as dairy and food fermenters, allochthonous probiotics, or autochthonous commensals of the host gastrointestinal tract. Bacterial cell surface components play a critical role in the molecular dialogue between bacteria and interaction signaling with the intestinal mucosa. Notably, the L. acidophilus complex is distinguished in two clades by the presence or absence of S-layers, which are semiporous crystalline arrays of self-assembling proteinaceous subunits found as the outermost layer of the bacterial cell wall. In this study, S-layer-associated proteins ({SLAPs}) in the exoproteomes of various S-layer-forming Lactobacillus species were proteomically identified, genomically compared, and transcriptionally analyzed. Four gene regions encoding six putative {SLAPs} were conserved in the S-layer-forming Lactobacillus species but not identified in the extracts of the closely related progenitor, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, which does not produce an S-layer. Therefore, the presence or absence of an S-layer has a clear impact on the exoproteomic composition of Lactobacillus species. This proteomic complexity and differences in the cell surface properties between S-layer- and non-S-layer-forming lactobacilli reveal the potential for {SLAPs} to mediate intimate probiotic interactions and signaling with the host intestinal mucosa.},

In particular, the nature and fraction of the terrestrial organic carbon preserved in marine sediments is poorly constrained. Here we use the chemical and stable carbon isotope signatures of oxidation products from a macromolecular component (lignin) of the terrigenous organic matter preserved in offshore surface sediments in the Gulf of Mexico to complement similar data from an existing onshore transect in this region. The complete onshore–offshore data set, along with radiocarbon dates of the bulk organic material at the same sites, allows the differentiation of material originating from plants that photosynthesize using the C4 mechanism from those that undergo C3 photosynthesis. We conclude that the offshore lignins derive from erosion of the extensive grassland (C4) soils of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and that the nearshore lignins originate largely from C3 plant detritus from coastal forests and swamps. This distribution is probably due to the hydrodynamic sorting of the different source materials during their seaward transport. These results suggest that previous studies have significantly underestimated the terrigenous fraction of organic matter in offshore sediments by not recognizing the contribution of C4 vegetation to the carbon-isotope composition. Such an underestimate may force revisions in the assessment of past marine primary productivity and associated organic carbon fluxes, and of organic matter preservation/remineralization and nutrient cycling in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of dissolved proteins as well as porin proteins was confirmed in water columns at five stations located in the North Pacific, the northern North Pacific, and the Bering Sea, where no investigation has heretofore been made with regard to dissolved protein. The major dissolved proteins detected in this study were determined to be glycosylated, based on the detection of an aldehyde group formed by the periodate oxidation of the electrophoretically separated dissolved proteins. The cross reactivity against lectins to the glycoproteins indicated that there were two types of linkage between sugar chain and polypeptide; one was an N-linked sugar chain and the other was an O-linked sugar chain. In this study, a previously reported dissolved protein with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kilodaltons was identified as an {OmpA}-like protein, not a porin protein but a major outer membrane protein of most pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. The survival of porin proteins in dissolved organic matter is thought to give rise to the resistant structure of these proteins; consequently, unidentified dissolved proteins could also be porin proteins. However, the occurrences of glycoproteins and an {OmpA}-like protein demonstrated that proteins other than porin proteins account for the majority of dissolved proteins, since no glycosylated porin protein is known. There must therefore be an additional mechanism by which dissolved proteins are protected from biological attack. The possibility that glycoprotein sugar chains can help preserve other dissolved proteins in seawater, as well as the glycoproteins themselves, is discussed herein.},

	abstract = {Fixed nitrogen is one of the main limiting nutrients for primary production in the ocean, where it is biologically available in the form of dissolved inorganic and organic matter. Inorganic nitrogen concentrations are consequently very low in surface waters of temperate ocean gyres, yet fixed nitrogen persists in the form of dissolved organic matter. The small, rapidly cycling organic compounds fundamental to microbial and planktonic growth (such as free amino acids, amines and urea) account for only a minor fraction of total dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}). In contrast, the vast majority of {DON}, especially in the deep ocean, resides in the form of nitrogenous substances that are resistant to biological degradation. These substances, which represent an enormous reservoir of fixed nitrogen, are not readily identified by conventional biochemical techniques, but have been assumed to consist largely of structurally complex macromolecules resulting from the degradation and spontaneous abiotic condensation of biochemical precursors. Here we present 15N {NMR} measurements that contradict this view. Our results show that most higher-molecular-weight {DON} in the ocean exists in amide form, rather than as a collection of nitrogen heterocycles that might be indicative of spontaneous condensation products. Because these amides are unlikely to form abiotically, the bulk of the ocean's {DON} reservoir appears to derive directly from degradation-resistant biomolecules.},

	abstract = {The biological carbon pump, which transports particulate organic carbon ({POC}) from the surface to the deep ocean, plays an important role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) concentrations. We know very little about geographical variability in the remineralization depth of this sinking material and less about what controls such variability. Here we present previously unpublished profiles of mesopelagic {POC} flux derived from neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed in the North Atlantic, from which we calculate the remineralization length scale for each site. Combining these results with corresponding data from the North Pacific, we show that the observed variability in attenuation of vertical {POC} flux can largely be explained by temperature, with shallower remineralization occurring in warmer waters. This is seemingly inconsistent with conclusions drawn from earlier analyses of deep-sea sediment trap and export flux data, which suggest lowest transfer efficiency at high latitudes. However, the two patterns can be reconciled by considering relatively intense remineralization of a labile fraction of material in warm waters, followed by efficient downward transfer of the remaining refractory fraction, while in cold environments, a larger labile fraction undergoes slower remineralization that continues over a longer length scale. Based on the observed relationship, future increases in ocean temperature will likely lead to shallower remineralization of {POC} and hence reduced storage of {CO}2 by the ocean.},

Until now, bacteria capable of anaerobically oxidizing ammonia had never been found and were known as "lithotrophs missing from nature".

In this approach, glycopeptides derived from glycoproteins are enriched by selective capture onto a solid support using hydrazide chemistry followed by enzymatic release of the peptides and subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The approach was validated using standard protein mixtures that resulted in a close to 100\% capture efficiency. Our capture approach was then applied to microsomal fractions of the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line {IGROV}-1/{CP}. With a Protein Prophet probability value greater than 0.9, we identified a total of 302 proteins with an average protein identification rate of 136 +/- 19 (n = 4) in a single linear quadrupole ion trap ({LTQ}) mass spectrometer nano-{LC}-{MS} experiment and a selectivity of 91 +/- 1.6\% (n = 4) for the N-linked glycoconsensus sequence. Our method has several advantages. 1) Digestion of proteins initially into peptides improves the solubility of large membrane proteins and exposes all of the glycosylation sites to ensure equal accessibility to capture reagents. 2) Capturing glycosylated peptides can effectively reduce sample complexity and at the same time increase the confidence of {MS}-based protein identifications (more potential peptide identifications per protein). 3) The utility of sodium sulfite as a quencher in our capture approach to replace the solid phase extraction step in an earlier glycoprotein chemical capture approach for removing excess sodium periodate allows the overall capture procedure to be completed in a single vessel. This improvement minimizes sample loss, increases sensitivity, and makes our protocol amenable for high throughput implementation, a feature that is essential for biomarker identification and validation of a large number of clinical samples. 4) The approach is demonstrated here on the analysis of N-linked glycopeptides; however, it can be applied equally well to O-glycoprotein analysis.},

	abstract = {An ammonia-oxidizing, carbon-fixing archaeon, Candidatus "Nitrosopumilus maritimus," recently was isolated from a salt-water aquarium, definitively confirming that chemoautotrophy exists among the marine archaea. However, in other incubation studies, pelagic archaea also were capable of using organic carbon. It has remained unknown what fraction of the total marine archaeal community is autotrophic in situ. If archaea live primarily as autotrophs in the natural environment, a large ammonia-oxidizing population would play a significant role in marine nitrification. Here we use the natural distribution of radiocarbon in archaeal membrane lipids to quantify the bulk carbon metabolism of archaea at two depths in the subtropical North Pacific gyre. Our compound-specific radiocarbon data show that the archaea in surface waters incorporate modern carbon into their membrane lipids, and archaea at 670 m incorporate carbon that is slightly more isotopically enriched than inorganic carbon at the same depth. An isotopic mass balance model shows that the dominant metabolism at depth indeed is autotrophy (83\%), whereas heterotrophic consumption of modern organic carbon accounts for the remainder of archaeal biomass. These results reflect the in situ production of the total community that produces tetraether lipids and are not subject to biases associated with incubation and/or culture experiments. The data suggest either that the marine archaeal community includes both autotrophs and heterotrophs or is a single population with a uniformly mixotrophic metabolism. The metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of the marine archaea warrants further exploration; these organisms may play a major role in the marine cycles of nitrogen and carbon.},

We show that this method allows the robust quantification of reference proteins in mixtures, and it detects concentration differences with high sensitivity when three replicas are performed. Applied to the analysis of the chloroplast stroma proteome, {HD}-{MSE} identified and quantified many chloroplast proteins that were not previously identified in large-scale proteome analyses, suggesting {HD}-{MSE} as a suitable complementary tool for discovery proteomics. We find that {HD}-{MSE} tends to underestimate protein abundances at concentrations above 25 fmol, which is likely due to ion transmission loss and detector saturation. This limitation can be circumvented by omitting the ion mobility separation step in the {HD}-{MSE} workflow. The robustness of protein quantification is influenced by the selection of peptides and their intensity distribution, therefore critical scrutiny of quantification results is required. Based on the {HD}-{MSE} quantification of chloroplast stroma proteins we performed a meta-analysis and compared published quantitative data with our results, using a parts per million normalization scheme. Important pathways in the chloroplast stroma show quantitative stability against different experimental conditions and quantification strategies.
Biological significance
Our analysis establishes {MSE}-based Hi3 quantification as a tool for the absolute quantification of proteins in the chloroplast stroma. The meta-analysis performed with a parts per million normalization scheme shows that quantitative proteomics data acquired in different labs and with different quantification strategies yield comparable results for some metabolic pathways, while others show a higher variability. Our data therefore indicate that such meta-analyses allow distinguishing robust from fine-controlled metabolic pathways.},

	abstract = {Peptide spectrum matching is the current gold standard for protein identification via mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Peptide spectrum matching compares experimental mass spectra against theoretical spectra generated from a protein sequence database to perform identification, but protein sequences not present in a database cannot be identified unless their sequences are in part conserved. The alternative approach, de novo sequencing, can make it possible to infer a peptide sequence directly from a mass spectrum, but interpreting long lists of peptide sequences resulting from large-scale experiments is not trivial. With this as motivation, {PepExplorer} was developed to use rigorous pattern recognition to assemble a list of homologue proteins using de novo sequencing data coupled to sequence alignment to allow biological interpretation of the data. {PepExplorer} can read the output of various widely adopted de novo sequencing tools and converge to a list of proteins with a global false-discovery rate. To this end, it employs a radial basis function neural network that considers precursor charge states, de novo sequencing scores, peptide lengths, and alignment scores to select similar protein candidates, from a target-decoy database, usually obtained from phylogenetically related species. Alignments are performed using a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm tailored for the task at hand. We verified the effectiveness of our approach using a reference set of identifications generated by {ProLuCID} when searching for Pyrococcus furiosus mass spectra on the corresponding {NCBI} {RefSeq} database. We then modified the sequence database by swapping amino acids until {ProLuCID} was no longer capable of identifying any proteins. By searching the mass spectra using {PepExplorer} on the modified database, we were able to recover most of the identifications at a 1\% false-discovery rate. Finally, we employed {PepExplorer} to disclose a comprehensive proteomic assessment of the Bothrops jararaca plasma, a known biological source of natural inhibitors of snake toxins. {PepExplorer} is integrated into the {PatternLab} for Proteomics environment, which makes available various tools for downstream data analysis, including resources for quantitative and differential proteomics.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms controlling microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, although microbes are crucial to global nutrient cycling. Bacterial cell wall components may be one of the keys in understanding the presence of slowly degrading {DOM} in nature. We found that dominant components of bacterial cell walls (D-amino acids (D-{AA}), glucosamine ({GluA}) and diaminopimelic acid ({DAPA})) comprised up to 11.4\% of the dissolved organic nitrogen in 50 diverse rivers entering the Baltic Sea. Occurrence of {DAPA}, a characteristic component of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria, in the rivers suggests that G(-) bacteria rather than Gram-positive (G(+)) were the major source of the cell wall material. In laboratory studies, the degradation of whole bacterial cells, cell wall material and purified peptidoglycan was studied to characterize degradation of cell wall material by natural aquatic bacteria. Addition of whole killed G(-) and G(+) bacteria to cultures of estuarine bacteria demonstrated fragmentation and loss of cell structure of the G(+) bacteria, while the G(-) bacteria maintained an intact cell shape during the entire 69-day period. In another experiment, estuarine bacteria degraded 39-69\% of {GluA}, D-{AA} and {DAPA} in added cell wall material of a representative G(-) bacterial species during 8 days, as compared to a 72-89\% degradation of {GluA}, D-{AA} and {DAPA} in cell material of a G(+) bacterial species. When cultures of estuarine bacteria were enriched with purified G(-) and G(+) peptidoglycan (1 mg l(-1)), at least 49\% (G(-)) and 58\% (G(+)) of D-{AA} in the peptidoglycan was degraded. No major changes in {GluA} were obvious. Interpretation of the results was difficult as a portion of the purified peptidoglycan was of similar size to the bacteria and could not be differentiated from cells growing in the cultures. Addition of the purified peptidoglycan stimulated the bacterial growth, and after 6 days the cell density in the enriched cultures was 4-fold higher than in the controls. A regrowth of bacteria after addition of L-broth at 105 days caused a 50- to 75-fold increase in dissolved D-{AA} and {GluA}. Most of the D-{AA} and {GluA} were taken up during the following 10 days, indicating that cell wall constituents are dynamic compounds. Our results show that a variable portion of peptidoglycan in G(-) and G(+) bacteria can be degraded by natural bacteria, and that peptidoglycan in G(-) bacteria is more resistant to bacterial attack than that in G(+) bacteria. Thus, the presence of cell wall constituents in natural {DOM} may reflect the recalcitrant nature of especially G(-) peptidoglycan.},

Bacterial {DOM} is similar in chemical composition and structural complexity to naturally occurring {DOM} in sea water. An appreciable fraction of bacterial {DOM} has molecular and structural properties that are consistent with those of refractory molecules in the ocean, indicating a dominant role for bacteria in shaping the refractory nature of marine {DOM}. The rapid production of chemically complex and persistent molecules from simple biochemicals demonstrates a positive feedback between primary production and refractory {DOM} formation.

	abstract = {Increasing wildfire activity in the Alaskan Arctic may result in new sources of black carbon ({BC}) to arctic watersheds. Black carbon, primarily comprised of condensed aromatics, is one of the most chemically recalcitrant fractions of organic carbon. However, lateral transfer of particulate and dissolved {BC} from soils to sunlit surface waters is increasingly suggested to result in the photochemical mineralization of {BC} to {CO}₂. While sunlight can also partially photooxidize aromatic compounds in surface waters, producing compounds with a higher O/C than the parent compound, this degradation pathway has not yet been identified for either particulate or dissolved {BC}. To address knowledge gaps on the photochemical degradation of particulate and dissolved {BC}, we quantified the complete and partial photooxidation of particulate and dissolved {BC} derived from arctic biomass as photochemical {CO}₂ production and O₂ consumption relative to dark controls. Concurrently, we investigated shifts in the chemical composition of dissolved {BC} following exposure to sunlight using {UV}-visible absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ({FT}-{ICR} {MS}). The chemical and physical properties of {BC} produced from charring arctic biomass were similar to {BC} produced by wildfires in terrestrial ecosystems based on elemental analysis and {FT}-{ICR} {MS}. Based on the concentration of light-absorbing carbon in each fraction, dissolved {BC} was disproportionately more susceptible to complete and partial photooxidation compared to particulate {BC}. Upon exposure to sunlight, the predominant fate of dissolved {BC} was partial photooxidation, while a smaller fraction of dissolved {BC} was photomineralized to {CO}₂. Shifts in both the optical and mass spectrometry spectra suggested that condensed aromatics likely comprised the fraction of dissolved {BC} that was completely and partially photooxidized. To further refine the meaning of sunlight as a sink for aquatic {BC}, the reactivity of partially oxidized photoproducts of {BC} in the aquatic organic carbon pool must be determined.},

Bacterial abundance, bacterial production, concentrations of {DOC}, total dissolved amino acids ({TDAA}), and total dissolved neutral sugars ({TDNS}) were monitored during the experiments. Bacterial production during the first few days was very high (20 to 35 μg C liter−1 day−1), accounting for 40 to 70\% of primary production. The total bacterial production accounted for 34 to 55\% of the {DOC} loss during the experiment, indicating high bacterial activities in Lake Kasumigaura. The {DOC} degradation was only 12 to 15\%, whereas the degradation of {TDAA} and {TDNS} ranged from 30 to 50\%, suggesting the preferential usage of {TDAA} and {TDNS}. The contribution of bacterially derived carbon to a {DOC} pool in Lake Kasumigaura was estimated using d-amino acids as bacterial biomarkers and accounted for 30 to 50\% of the lake {DOC}. These values were much higher than those estimated for the open ocean (20 to 30\%). The ratio of bacterially derived carbon to bulk carbon increased slightly with time, suggesting that the bacterially derived carbon is more resistant to microbial degradation than bulk carbon. This is the first study to estimate the bacterial contribution to a {DOC} pool in freshwater environments. These results indicate that bacteria play even more important roles in carbon cycles in freshwater environments than in open oceans and also suggests that recent increases in recalcitrant {DOC} in various lakes could be attributed to bacterially derived carbon. The potential differences in bacterial contributions to dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) between freshwater and marine environments are discussed.},

	abstract = {Black carbon ({BC}) is an important pool of the global C cycle, because it cycles much more slowly than others and may even be managed for C sequestration. Using stable isotope techniques, we investigated the fate of {BC} applied to a savanna Oxisol in Colombia at rates of 0, 11.6, 23.2 and 116.1 t {BC} ha−1, as well as its effect on non-{BC} soil organic C. During the rainy seasons of 2005 and 2006, soil respiration was measured using soda lime traps, particulate and dissolved organic C ({POC} and {DOC}) moving by saturated flow was sampled continuously at 0.15 and 0.3 m, and soil was sampled to 2.0 m. Black C was found below the application depth of 0–0.1 m in the 0.15–0.3 m depth interval, with migration rates of 52.4±14.5, 51.8±18.5 and 378.7±196.9 kg C ha−1 yr−1 (±{SE}) where 11.6, 23.2 and 116.1 t {BC} ha−1, respectively, had been applied. Over 2 years after application, 2.2\% of {BC} applied at 23.2 t {BC} ha−1 was lost by respiration, and an even smaller fraction of 1\% was mobilized by percolating water. Carbon from {BC} moved to a greater extent as {DOC} than {POC}. The largest flux of {BC} from the field (20–53\% of applied {BC}) was not accounted for by our measurements and is assumed to have occurred by surface runoff during intense rain events. Black C caused a 189\% increase in aboveground biomass production measured 5 months after application (2.4–4.5 t additional dry biomass ha−1 where {BC} was applied), and this resulted in greater amounts of non-{BC} being respired, leached and found in soil for the duration of the experiment. These increases can be quantitatively explained by estimates of greater belowground net primary productivity with {BC} addition.},

Here we present a simple model for {BC} movement and decomposition in soils based on the assumption that {BC} consists of two fractions with different turnover time, and that {BC} can move in the environment as well as decompose. Decomposition rate was calibrated against laboratory data, whilst a recent field experiment was used to calibrate losses from downward movement through the soil profile. Losses by erosion are still poorly quantified, but mass balance indicates that they may be one of the most important fluxes. The model was able to acceptably predict {CO}2 production from {BC} as well as {BC} left in the soil at the end of the experiment, although {BC} in the subsoil was underestimated. The model was sensitive to erosion rate (varied ±50\%), moisture and temperature response function on a 100-year time scale. The model was not sensitive to the decomposition rate of the stable pool on a 100 year time scale, but it was very sensitive to that on a millennial time scale.

Given that a similar relationship between climate drivers and fire emerges from analyses of the interannual variability in biomass burning shown by remote-sensing observations of month-by-month burnt area between 1996 and 2008, our results signal a serious cause for concern in the face of continuing global warming.},

Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.
Climate change in the western United States has dramatically increased the number of large forest wildfires during the past 35 years.

	abstract = {Recent climatic warming has resulted in pronounced environmental changes in the Arctic, including shrub cover expansion and sea ice shrinkage. These changes foreshadow more dramatic impacts that will occur if the warming trend continues. Among the major challenges in anticipating these impacts are “surprises” stemming from changes in system components that have remained relatively stable in the historic record. Tundra burning is potentially one such component. Here we report paleoecological evidence showing that recent tundra burning is unprecedented in the central Alaskan Arctic within the last 5000 years. Analysis of lake sediment cores reveals peak values of charcoal accumulation corresponding to the Anaktuvuk River Fire in 2007, with no evidence of other fire events throughout the past five millennia in that area. Atmospheric reanalysis suggests that the fire was favored by exceptionally warm and dry weather conditions in summer and early autumn. Boosted regression tree modeling shows that such conditions also explain 95\% of the interannual variability in tundra area burned throughout Alaska over the past 60 years and that the response of tundra burning to climatic warming is nonlinear. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence suggesting that tundra ecosystems can burn more frequently under suitable climatic and fuel conditions. The Anaktuvuk River Fire coincides with extreme sea ice retreat, and tundra area burned in Alaska is moderately correlated with sea ice extent from 1979 to 2009 (r = −0.43, p = 0.02). Recurrences of large tundra fires as a result of sea ice disappearance may represent a novel manifestation of coupled marine-terrestrial responses to climatic warming.},

Fire is a key process in this context, but the consequences of altered fire regimes in tundra ecosystems are rarely considered, largely because tundra fires occur infrequently on the modern landscape. We present paleoecological data that indicate frequent tundra fires in northcentral Alaska between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. Charcoal and pollen from lake sediments reveal that ancient birch-dominated shrub tundra burned as often as modern boreal forests in the region, every 144 years on average (+/- 90 s.d.; n = 44). Although paleoclimate interpretations and data from modern tundra fires suggest that increased burning was aided by low effective moisture, vegetation cover clearly played a critical role in facilitating the paleofires by creating an abundance of fine fuels. These records suggest that greater fire activity will likely accompany temperature-related increases in shrub-dominated tundra predicted for the 21(st) century and beyond. Increased tundra burning will have broad impacts on physical and biological systems as well as on land-atmosphere interactions in the Arctic, including the potential to release stored organic carbon to the atmosphere.},

Dissolved organic matter is important for aquatic food webs and, integrated over the entire volume of the world's oceans, contains roughly as much carbon as all living biota on land and in the ocean combined. Yet, the cycling of dissolved organic matter in the ocean is not well understood. Recent progress in analytical chemistry has allowed the characterization of dissolved organic matter at the molecular level in unprecedented detail, revealing that a significant proportion has been thermally altered, either in deep sediments or through combustion on land with later delivery to the sea. Thermal alteration may explain, at least in part, the resistance of oceanic dissolved organic matter to microbial decomposition.},

The year 2007 in particular not only was unique in terms of minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean but also was a record breaking year for Eurasian river inflow to the Arctic Ocean. Over the observational period from 1936 to 2006, the mean annual river discharge for the six largest Russian rivers was 1796 km 3 y −1 , with the previous record high being 2080 km 3 y −1 , in 2002. The year 2007 showed a massive flux of fresh water from these six drainage basins of 2254 km 3 y −1 . We investigated the hydroclimatological conditions for such extreme river discharge and found that while that year's flow was unusually high, the overall spatial patterns were consistent with the hydroclimatic trends since 1980, indicating that 2007 was not an aberration but a part of the general trend. We wanted to extend our hydroclimatological analysis of river discharge anomalies to seasonal and monthly time steps; however, there were limits to such analyses due to the direct human impact on the river systems. Using reconstructions of the naturalized hydrographs over the Yenisey basin we defined the limits to analysis due to the effect of reservoirs on river discharge. For annual time steps the trends are less impacted by dam construction, whereas for seasonal and monthly time steps these data are confounded by the two sources of change, and the climate change signals were overwhelmed by the human-induced river impoundments. We offer two solutions to this problem; first, we recommend wider use of algorithms to 'naturalize' the river discharge data and, second, we suggest the identification of a network of existing and stable river monitoring sites to be used for climate change analysis.},

A new recalcitrance index, the R50, for assessing biochar quality for carbon sequestration is proposed. The R50 is based on the relative thermal stability of a given biochar to that of graphite and was developed and evaluated with a variety of biochars (n = 59), and soot-like black carbons. Comparison of R50, with biochar physicochemical properties and biochar-C mineralization revealed the existence of a quantifiable relationship between R50 and biochar recalcitrance. As presented here, the R50 is immediately applicable to pre-land application screening of biochars into Class A (R50 ≥ 0.70), Class B (0.50 ≤ R50 {\textless} 0.70) or Class C (R50 {\textless} 0.50) recalcitrance/carbon sequestration classes. Class A and Class C biochars would have carbon sequestration potential comparable to soot/graphite and uncharred plant biomass, respectively, whereas Class B biochars would have intermediate carbon sequestration potential. We believe that the coupling of the R50, to an index-based degradation, and an economic model could provide a suitable framework in which to comprehensively assess soil carbon sequestration in biochars.},

This process is closely tied to the chemistry of iron, which primarily exists as dissolved Fe({II}) and Fe({III})?organic complexes in initial {DOM} and photochemically matures to Fe({III}) oxyhydroxides before coprecipitating out with {POM}. The newly formed condensed aromatic compounds resemble black carbon, which until now was thought to be produced by only combustion. These new molecules contribute a pool of Fe-rich, aliphatic, and black carbon-like organic matter to sediments as the terrestrial {DOM} is transported through rivers. We estimate that the annual global flux of this photoproduced black carbon, most of which may be preserved in sediments, is nearly equivalent to the estimated flux of dissolved black carbon to the ocean from all other sources.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric deposition of total organic carbon ({OC}) and black carbon ({BC}) is lacking or not fully accounted in most current models of the global carbon cycling, specially those fluxes related to gas phase {OC}. Here, we develop and apply a methodology to estimate wet and dry deposition of total {OC} to the oceans, based on monthly satellite measurements of aerosol size distributions, wind speed, etc., and estimates of deposition for aerosols and organic compounds. The parameterization of dry deposition velocities account for the dependence of turbulent transport with aerosol diameter, wind speed and the formation of marine aerosol, etc. Gravitational settling is estimated as a function of wet particle diameter, thus including hygroscopic growth due to ambient humidity. Global dry deposition of aerosol {OC} is estimated to be 11 Tg C y−1 and wet deposition of particle and gaseous {OC} are estimated as 47 and 187 Tg C y−1, respectively. Due to their pulsing variability, wet deposition fluxes can be important locally and as a temporal source of {OC} to surface waters. Dry and wet deposition of black carbon to the global ocean are estimated to be 2 and 10 Tg C yr−1, respectively, with higher fluxes in the northern hemisphere and for inter-tropical regions. Finally, considerations on the potential magnitude of the hitherto neglected gross air–sea diffusive exchange fluxes of {OC} are discussed. Even though the magnitude and direction of these cannot be constrained here, evidence of its important role is given. This study, thus, shows that there is an important spatial and temporal variability in atmosphere–ocean exchanges of {OC} and {BC} at different scales, and calls for the need for further research on the important role that these exchanges play in the global carbon cycle.},

Biomass burning produces 40 to 250 million tons of charcoal per year worldwide. Much of this is preserved in soils and sediments for thousands of years. However, the estimated production rate of charcoal is significantly larger than that of decomposition, and Jaffe et al. (p. 345; see the Perspective by Masiello and Louchouarn) calculate that a large fraction of the charcoal produced by fires is lost from the land through dissolution and transport to the oceans.
Global biomass burning generates 40 million to 250 million tons of charcoal every year, part of which is preserved for millennia in soils and sediments. We have quantified dissolution products of charcoal in a wide range of rivers worldwide and show that globally, a major portion of the annual charcoal production is lost from soils via dissolution and subsequent transport to the ocean. The global flux of soluble charcoal accounts to 26.5 ± 1.8 million tons per year, which is {\textasciitilde}10\% of the global riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}). We suggest that the mobilization of charcoal and {DOC} out of soils is mechanistically coupled. This study closes a major gap in the global charcoal budget and provides critical information in the context of geoengineering.
A larger-than-assumed fraction of charcoal produced by wildfires leaches out of soils and is transported to the oceans. [Also see Perspective by Masiello and Louchouarn]

	abstract = {Wildfires have produced black carbon ({BC}) since land plants emerged. Condensed aromatic compounds, a form of {BC}, have accumulated to become a major component of the soil carbon pool. Condensed aromatics leach from soils into rivers, where they are termed dissolved black carbon ({DBC}). The transport of {DBC} by rivers to the sea is a major term in the global carbon and {BC} cycles. To estimate Arctic river {DBC} export, 25 samples collected from the six largest Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon) were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}), colored dissolved organic matter ({CDOM}), and {DBC}. A simple, linear regression between {DOC} and {DBC} indicated that {DBC} accounted for 8.9 ± 0.3\% of {DOC} exported by Arctic rivers. To improve upon this estimate, an optical proxy for {DBC} was developed based upon the linear correlation between {DBC} concentrations and {CDOM} light absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a254). Relatively easy to measure a254 values were determined for 410 Arctic river samples between 2004 and 2010. Each of these a254 values was converted to a {DBC} concentration based upon the linear correlation, providing an extended record of {DBC} concentration. The extended {DBC} record was coupled with daily discharge data from the six rivers to estimate riverine {DBC} loads using the {LOADEST} modeling program. The six rivers studied cover 53\% of the pan-Arctic watershed and exported 1.5 ± 0.1 million tons of {DBC} per year. Scaling up to the full area of the pan-Arctic watershed, we estimate that Arctic rivers carry 2.8 ± 0.3 million tons of {DBC} from land to the Arctic Ocean each year. This equates to {\textasciitilde}8\% of Arctic river {DOC} export, slightly less than indicated by the simpler {DBC} vs. {DOC} correlation-based estimate. Riverine discharge is predicted to increase in a warmer Arctic. {DBC} export was positively correlated with river runoff, suggesting that the export of soil {BC} to the Arctic Ocean is likely to increase as the Arctic warms.},

In addition to their impact on land degradation, wildfires cause deforestation, damage to ecosystems and promote land use change; apart from being the source of emissions of toxic substances to the environment (i.e., hydrogen cyanide, black carbon and organic carbon). Black carbon is a short-lived greenhouse pollutant that also promotes snow and ice melting and decreased rainfall; it has an estimated global warming potential close to 5000.1 We present an estimate of the black carbon and organic carbon emissions from wildfires in Mexico from 2000 to 2012 using selected emission factors from the literature and activity data from local agencies. The results show average emissions of 5955 Mg/yr for black carbon and 62 085 Mg/yr for organic carbon. Black carbon emissions are estimated to be 14 888 Gg {CO}2 equivalent ({CO}2 eq) per year on average. With proper management of wildfires, such emissions can be mitigated. Moreover, improved air quality, conservation of ecosystems, improvement of visibility and maintenance of land use are a subset of the related co-benefits. Mitigating forest organic carbon emissions, which are ten times higher than black carbon emissions, would also prevent the morbidity and mortality impacts of toxic organic compounds in the environment.1
The {GWP} is calculated as the ratio of the Absolute Global Warming Potential ({AGWP}) of a given gas to the {AGWP} of {CO}2. The {AGWP} has units of Wm–2 g–1 yr.},

However, the available information on black carbon in marine dissolved organic matter ({DOM}), one of the largest organic carbon pools, is extremely scarce. The objective of this study was to introduce an analytical technique for the routine determination of black carbon in marine {DOM}. Dissolved black carbon was isolated from seawater via solid phase extraction. The salt free extracts were oxidized with nitric acid in a microwave digestion system. Oxidation temperature and duration were optimized to yield maximum amounts of benzenepolycarboxylic acids ({BPCAs}) from condensed aromatic structures. {BPCAs} were separated and quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography and diode-array detection ({HPLC}–{DAD}). Minimal sample processing and no derivatization are required which makes the method practical for routine analysis. The technique was tested on a suite of reference materials and applied to coastal and open ocean {DOM}. One half liter of seawater from the open Gulf of Mexico was sufficient for reliable analysis. Black carbon free {DOM} from algal cultures and organic tissues did not yield detectable amounts of {BPCA} (\&lt;0.02\% of total dissolved organic carbon, {DOC}), whereas all seawater samples yielded significant amounts of {BPCA}. An algorithm was developed for the transformation of {BPCA} into black carbon concentrations in the ocean. Black carbon concentrations decreased from near to offshore from 3.7 to 0.8 {mM} C (2.6–0.9\% of {DOC}). The proportion of the individual {BPCAs} provided basic structural information on dissolved black carbon. Low proportions of hexacarboxylic acids (B6CA) in marine {DOM} is consistent with the relatively small size (seven condensed rings) deduced from mass spectrometry data.},

The basic information on the significance of the microbial food web was put forth eloquently by Pomeroy (1974), who pieced together data from a variety of sources that all indicated a major role of small heterotrophs consuming dissolved and particulate material. However, these ideas did not gain wide recognition until the high abundance of marine bacteria was shown by epifluorescence microscopy (Ferguson and Rublee, 1976; Hobbie et al., 1977), and the bacterial heterotrophic production was shown to be large (i.e., 10–30\%) compared to primary production (Hagstrőm et al., 1979; Fuhrman and Azam, 1980; 1982). With reasonable estimates of bacterial growth efficiency (i.e., near 50\%), it became clear that heterotrophic bacteria consume an amount of carbon equivalent to approximately 20–60\% of total primary production. Williams (1981) reached this conclusion when he synthesized the extant results on bacterial biomass and production. He also showed that “normal” well-known processes and mechanisms could lead to as much as 60\% of the primary production becoming dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}), and subsequently, being taken up by bacteria. Azam et al. (1983) formalized the concept of the microbial loop by which significant quantities of organic matter are produced or processed through prokaryotic and very small eukaryotic organisms, eventually feeding into the larger macrozooplankton.},

The introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera — Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thallassolituus, Cycloclasticus, Oleispira and a few others (the {OHCB}) — which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event. The types of {OHCB} that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of {OHCB}, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success. These and other studies have revealed the potential of {OHCB} for multiple biotechnological applications that include not only oil pollution mitigation, but also biopolymer production and biocatalysis.},

Among the various bioactive compounds, biosurfactant ({BS})/bioemulsifiers ({BE}) are attracting major interest and attention due to their structural and functional diversity. The versatile properties of surface active molecules find numerous applications in various industries. Marine microorganisms such as Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Myroides, Corynebacteria, Bacillus, Alteromonas sp. have been studied for production of {BS}/{BE} and exopolysaccharides ({EPS}). Due to the enormity of marine biosphere, most of the marine microbial world remains unexplored. The discovery of potent {BS}/{BE} producing marine microorganism would enhance the use of environmental biodegradable surface active molecule and hopefully reduce total dependence or number of new application oriented towards the chemical synthetic surfactant industry. Our present review gives comprehensive information on {BS}/{BE} which has been reported to be produced by marine microorganisms and their possible potential future applications.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the impact of surfactant addition on hydrocarbon mineralization kinetics and the associated population shifts of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in soil. A mixture of radiolabeled hexadecane and phenanthrene was added to batch soil vessels. Witconol {SN}70 (a nonionic, alcohol ethoxylate) was added in concentrations that bracketed the critical micelle concentration ({CMC}) in soil ({CMC}') (determined to be 13 mg g(-1)). Addition of the surfactant at a concentration below the {CMC}' (2 mg g(-1)) did not affect the mineralization rates of either hydrocarbon. However, when surfactant was added at a concentration approaching the {CMC}' (10 mg g(-1)), hexadecane mineralization was delayed and phenanthrene mineralization was completely inhibited. Addition of surfactant at concentrations above the {CMC}' (40 mg g(-1)) completely inhibited mineralization of both phenanthrene and hexadecane. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S {rRNA} gene segments showed that hydrocarbon amendment stimulated Rhodococcus and Nocardia populations that were displaced by Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes populations at elevated surfactant levels. Parallel cultivation studies revealed that the Rhodococcus population can utilize hexadecane and that the Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes populations can utilize both Witconol {SN}70 and hexadecane for growth. The results suggest that surfactant applications necessary to achieve the {CMC} alter the microbial populations responsible for hydrocarbon mineralization.},

The four Pseudomonas lipopeptides yielded emulsification indices on hexadecane of 20-31\% at 90 mg/l, which is comparable to values for the synthetic surfactant Tween 80. Viscosin was the optimal emulsifier and significantly stimulated n-hexadecane mineralization by diesel-degrading bacterial consortia but exclusively during the first 2 days of batch culture experiments. Growth of the consortia, as determined by {OD}₆₀₀ measurements and quantification of the {alkB} marker gene for alkane degradation, was arrested after the first day of the experiment. In contrast, the control consortia continued to grow and reached higher {OD}₆₀₀ values and higher {alkB} copy numbers during the next days. Due to the short-lived stimulation of n-hexadecane mineralization, the stability of viscosin was analyzed, and it was observed that added viscosin was degraded by the bacterial consortium during the first 2 days. Hence, viscosin has a potential as stimulator of alkane degradation, but its utility in bioremediation may be limited by its rapid degradation and growth-inhibiting properties.},

In biodegradation processes they mediate solubilisation, mobilization and/or accession of hydrophobic substrates to microbes. They may be located on the cell surface or be secreted into the extracellular medium and they facilitate uptake of hydrophobic molecules through direct cellular contact with hydrophobic solids or droplets or through micellarisation. They are also involved in cell physiological processes such as biofilm formation and detachment, and in diverse biofilm associated processes such as wastewater treatment and microbial pathogenesis. The protection of contaminants in biosurfactants micelles may also inhibit uptake of contaminants by microbes. In bioremediation processes biosurfactants may facilitate release of contaminants from soil, but soils also tend to bind surfactants strongly which makes their role in contaminant desorption more complex. A greater understanding of the underlying roles played by biosurfactants in microbial physiology and in biodegradative processes is developing through advances in cell and molecular biology.},

	abstract = {Biosurfactants are produced by hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacteria in response to the presence of water-insoluble hydrocarbons. This is believed to facilitate the uptake of hydrocarbons by bacteria. However, these diffusible amphiphilic surface-active molecules are involved in several other biological functions such as microbial competition and intra-or inter-species communication. We report the isolation and characterization of a marine bacterial strain identified as Cobetia sp. {MM}1IDA2H-1, which can grow using the sulfur-containing heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dibenzothiophene ({DBT}). As with {DBT}, when the isolated strain is grown in the presence of a microbial competitor, it produces a biosurfactant. Because the obtained biosurfactant was formed by hydroxy fatty acids and extracellular lipidic structures were observed during bacterial growth, we investigated whether the biosurfactant at its critical micelle concentration can interfere with bacterial communication systems such as quorum sensing. We focused on Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, a fish pathogen whose virulence relies on quorum sensing signals. Using biosensors for quorum sensing based on Chromobacterium violaceum and Vibrio anguillarum, we showed that when the purified biosurfactant was mixed with N-acyl homoserine lactones produced by A. salmonicida, quorum sensing was inhibited, although bacterial growth was not affected. In addition, the transcriptional activities of A. salmonicida virulence genes that are controlled by quorum sensing were repressed by both the purified biosurfactant and the growth in the presence of Cobetia sp. {MM}1IDA2H-1. We propose that the biosurfactant, or the lipid structures interact with the N-acyl homoserine lactones, inhibiting their function. This could be used as a strategy to interfere with the quorum sensing systems of bacterial fish pathogens, which represents an attractive alternative to classical antimicrobial therapies in fish aquaculture.},

In aquatic environments, this virus-mediated transformation of living cells into dissolved and colloidal organic matter may be a quantitatively important process in the pelagic recycling of carbon and nutrients, but little is known about the amount, composition, or bioavailability of viral lysates. By using a model system of a marine bacterium (Cellulophaga sp.) and a virus specific to this bacterium, the present study provides a first quantification of the input of dissolved free and combined amino acids ({DFAA} and {DCAA}) and bacterial cell wall compounds following viral lysis. The {DCAA} constituted 51–86\% of the total virus-mediated organic carbon release of 1087–1825 μg C l−1 (estimated biomass of the lysed bacteria), whereas {DFAA} and glucosamine each accounted for 2–3\% of total lysate-C. The viral particles themselves constituted 4–6\% of the released organic carbon, and altogether, the applied analyses thus identified 53–92\% of the released lysates. Approximately 12\% of the identified compounds were derived from bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, including various D-isomers of {DFAA} and {DCAA}, glucosamine and diaminopimelic acid ({DAPA}). Although a portion of this cell wall material may have entered the pool of refractory material, a significant fraction of some peptidoglycan-derived components, e.g. 83\% of the released D-{DFAA}, were removed from the dissolved phase during the last part of the incubations, suggesting that part of the cell wall material were utilized by the developing virus-resistant Cellulophaga population. Therefore, we suggest that virus-mediated {DOM} is a source of a variety of organic compounds, which contribute significantly to the pool of rapidly recycling material in the ocean.},

In 1 set of cultures (-virus), a virus-free water sample (0.02 μm filtered) was inoculated with a bacterioplankton concentrate, and in a parallel set of cultures (control) a virus-containing water sample (0.2 μm filtered) was inoculated with the bacterioplankton concentrate. The 0.02 μm filtration procedure reduced viral abundance by 62 to 92\% in the -virus cultures relative to the parallel control cultures with the natural density of viruses (i.e. the fraction of natural viruses {\textless}0.2 μm). This approach allowed us to examine the effects of reduced viral densities on the production of natural assemblages of bacteria and viruses and on the distribution of added 3H-thymidine into size fractions (the bacterial size fraction, viral size fraction, dissolved size fraction and respired fraction). The results showed significantly higher bacterial net growth and growth efficiency in cultures with a reduced abundance of viruses relative to control cultures with natural viral abundance, and indicated viral regulation of bacterial abundance in the control cultures. We suggest that viral lysis significantly affected the bacterial carbon cycling in the cultures by liberating a fraction of the organic matter already taken up by the bacteria, thus stimulating recycling of bacterial carbon and reducing the net bacterial production. The implications of such regeneration of dissolved organic matter by viral lysis for pelagic carbon cycling and for measurements of bacterial production are discussed.},

	abstract = {Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr−1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m−2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m−2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m−2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m−2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (−0.50 to +1.08) W m−2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (−0.06 W m−2 with 90\% uncertainty bounds of −1.45 to +1.29 W m−2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates.},

The isolation of Candidatus "Nitrosopumilus maritimus" strain {SCM}1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. Here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain {SCM}1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates N. maritimus grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. This unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry. The conservation of N. maritimus gene content and organization within marine metagenomes indicates that the unique physiology of these specialized oligophiles may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen.},

Recently, a member of this clade was isolated from a sea aquarium and shown to be capable of nitrification, tentatively suggesting that Crenarchaeota may play a role in the oceanic nitrogen cycle. We enriched a crenarchaeote from North Sea water and showed that its abundance, and not that of bacteria, correlates with ammonium oxidation to nitrite. A time series study in the North Sea revealed that the abundance of the gene encoding for the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase alfa subunit ({amoA}) is correlated with a decline in ammonium concentrations and with the abundance of Crenarchaeota. Remarkably, the archaeal {amoA} abundance was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those of bacterial nitrifiers, which are commonly thought to mediate the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite in marine environments. Analysis of Atlantic waters of the upper 1,000 m, where most of the ammonium regeneration and oxidation takes place, showed that crenarchaeotal {amoA} copy numbers are also 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those of bacterial {amoA}. Our data thus suggest a major role for Archaea in oceanic nitrification.},

Therefore, an increasing number of publications deal with in situ studies of natural bacterial populations participating in this process. However, some crucial points complicate suchlike investigations. At the time being, a total of 25 species of ammonia-oxidizers and eight species of nitrite-oxidizers are cultured but the existence of many more species has been indicated by molecular in situ investigations. With that, only a part of the existing nitrifiers has been defined via isolation and subsequent physiological and molecular characterization. Furthermore, the distribution patterns of the distinct species of nitrifiers depend on various environmental parameters. Hence the composition of nitrifying bacterial communities is complex and divers in heterogeneous habitats. In consequence of the above-mentioned problems, the representation of nitrifying community structures obtained from in situ investigations often has been incomplete and unbalanced in many respects. Polyphasic approaches, applying a combination of classical as well as molecular methods in parallel, could help to find the way for overcoming these problems in the future. Isolation and characterization of as many as possible new species seems to be one of the most important missing steps to advance at this way.},

In some cases, these microbial associates comprise as much as 40\% of the sponge volume and can contribute significantly to host metabolism (e.g., via photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation). We review in detail the diversity of microbes associated with sponges, including extensive 16S {rRNA}-based phylogenetic analyses which support the previously suggested existence of a sponge-specific microbiota. These analyses provide a suitable vantage point from which to consider the potential evolutionary and ecological ramifications of these widespread, sponge-specific microorganisms. Subsequently, we examine the ecology of sponge-microbe associations, including the establishment and maintenance of these sometimes intimate partnerships, the varied nature of the interactions (ranging from mutualism to host-pathogen relationships), and the broad-scale patterns of symbiont distribution. The ecological and evolutionary importance of sponge-microbe associations is mirrored by their enormous biotechnological potential: marine sponges are among the animal kingdom's most prolific producers of bioactive metabolites, and in at least some cases, the compounds are of microbial rather than sponge origin. We review the status of this important field, outlining the various approaches (e.g., cultivation, cell separation, and metagenomics) which have been employed to access the chemical wealth of sponge-microbe associations.},

The symbiotic prokaryotic communities of X. muta were significantly different than the surrounding bacterioplankton communities while an analysis of similarity ({ANOSIM}) of the sponge prokaryotic symbionts from three geographically distant sites showed that both symbiont and bacterioplankton populations were significantly different between locations. Comparisons of individual sponges based on the {UniFrac} P-test also revealed significant differences in community composition between individual sponges. The sponges harbored a variety of phylum level operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) common to many sponges, including Cyanobacteria, Poribacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes, but four additional symbiotic phyla, previously not reported for this sponge, were observed. Additionally, a diverse archaeal community was also recovered from X. muta including sequences representing the phyla Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. These results have important ecological implications for the understanding of host–microbe associations, and provide a foundation for future studies addressing the functional roles these symbiotic prokaryotes have in the biology of the host sponge and the nutrient biogeochemistry of coral reefs.},

However, molecular phylogenetic surveys of native microbial assemblages are beginning to indicate that the evolutionary and physiological diversity of Archaea is far greater than previously supposed. We report here the discovery and preliminary characterization of a marine archaeon that inhabits the tissues of a temperate water sponge. The association was specific, with a single crenarchaeal phylotype inhabiting a single sponge host species. To our knowledge, this partnership represents the first described symbiosis involving Crenarchaeota. The symbiotic archaeon grows well at temperatures of 10 degrees C, over 60 degrees C below the growth temperature optimum of any cultivated species of Crenarchaeota. Archaea have been generally characterized as microorganisms that inhabit relatively circumscribed niches, largely high-temperature anaerobic environments. In contrast, data from molecular phylogenetic surveys, including this report, suggest that some crenarchaeotes have diversified considerably and are found in a wide variety of lifestyles and habitats. We present here the identification and initial description of Cenarchaeum symbiosum gen. nov., sp. nov., a symbiotic archaeon closely related to other nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes that inhabit diverse marine and terrestrial environments.},

Previous studies of photoinhibition have been restricted to bacterial ammonia oxidizers, rather than archaeal ammonia oxidizers, which dominate in marine environments. To compare the photoinhibition of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers, specific growth rates of two ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Nitrosotalea devanaterra) and bacteria (Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosospira multiformis) were determined at different light intensities under continuous illumination and light/dark cycles. All strains were inhibited by continuous illumination at the highest intensity (500 μE m(-2) s(-1)). At lower light intensities, archaeal growth was much more photosensitive than bacterial growth, with greater inhibition at 60 μE m(-2) s(-1) than at 15 μE m(-2) s(-1), where bacteria were unaffected. Archaeal ammonia oxidizers were also more sensitive to cycles of 8-h light/16-h darkness at two light intensities (60 and 15 μE m(-2) s(-1)) and, unlike bacterial strains, showed no evidence of recovery during dark phases. The findings provide evidence for niche differentiation in aquatic environments and reduce support for photoinhibition as an explanation of nitrite maxima in the ocean.},

Nitrification rates in acidic soils ({pH} {\textless} 5.5), which comprise 30\% of the world's soils, equal or exceed those of neutral soils. Paradoxically, autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea, which perform the first stage in nitrification, demonstrate little or no growth in suspended liquid culture below {pH} 6.5, at which ammonia availability is reduced by ionization. Here we report the discovery and cultivation of a chemolithotrophic, obligately acidophilic thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidizer, "Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra," from an acidic agricultural soil. Phylogenetic analysis places the organism within a previously uncultivated thaumarchaeal lineage that has been observed in acidic soils. Growth of the organism is optimal in the {pH} range 4 to 5 and is restricted to the {pH} range 4 to 5.5, unlike all previously cultivated ammonia oxidizers. Growth of this organism and associated ammonia oxidation and autotrophy also occur during nitrification in soil at {pH} 4.5. The discovery of Nitrosotalea devanaterra provides a previously unsuspected explanation for high rates of nitrification in acidic soils, and confirms the vital role that thaumarchaea play in terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Growth at extremely low ammonia concentration (0.18 {nM}) also challenges accepted views on ammonia uptake and metabolism and indicates novel mechanisms for ammonia oxidation at low {pH}.},

The limited physiological diversity among cultivated Archaea suggested that these organisms were metabolically constrained to a few environmental niches. For instance, all Crenarchaeota that are currently cultivated are sulphur-metabolizing thermophiles. However, landmark studies using cultivation-independent methods uncovered vast numbers of Crenarchaeota in cold oxic ocean waters. Subsequent molecular surveys demonstrated the ubiquity of these low-temperature Crenarchaeota in aquatic and terrestrial environments. The numerical dominance of marine Crenarchaeota—estimated at 1028 cells in the world's oceans—suggests that they have a major role in global biogeochemical cycles. Indeed, isotopic analyses of marine crenarchaeal lipids suggest that these planktonic Archaea fix inorganic carbon. Here we report the isolation of a marine crenarchaeote that grows chemolithoautotrophically by aerobically oxidizing ammonia to nitrite—the first observation of nitrification in the Archaea. The autotrophic metabolism of this isolate, and its close phylogenetic relationship to environmental marine crenarchaeal sequences, suggests that nitrifying marine Crenarchaeota may be important to global carbon and nitrogen cycles.},

Estimates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification continue to be modified, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation has been identified as a new process involved in denitrification in oxygen minimum zones.

In particular, the unusually high affinity of marine and terrestrial {AOA} for ammonia indicates that this group may determine the oxidation state of nitrogen available to associated micro- and macrobiota, altering our current understanding of trophic interactions. Initial comparative genomics and physiological studies have revealed a novel, and as yet unresolved, primarily copper-based pathway for ammonia oxidation and respiration distinct from that of known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and possibly relevant to the production of atmospherically active nitrogen oxides. Comparative studies also provide compelling evidence that the lineage of Archaea with which the {AOA} affiliate is sufficiently divergent to justify the creation of a novel phylum, the Thaumarchaeota.},

At concentrations of approximately 10 million viruses per milliliter of surface seawater, viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans. The majority of these viruses are phages (viruses that infect bacteria). Through lysing their bacterial hosts, marine phages control bacterial abundance, affect community composition, and impact global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, phages influence their hosts through selection for resistance, horizontal gene transfer, and manipulation of bacterial metabolism. Recent work has also demonstrated that marine phages are extremely diverse and can carry a variety of auxiliary metabolic genes encoding critical ecological functions. This review is structured as a scientific “truth or dare,” revealing several well-established “truths” about marine viruses and presenting a few “dares” for the research community to undertake in future studies.},

While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.},

	abstract = {Peptidoglycan is the major structural component of bacterial cell walls. In this era of increasingly antibiotic resistant pathogens, peptidoglycan hydrolases that degrade this important cell wall structure have emerged as a potential novel source of new antimicrobials. Included in this class are bacteriocins (lysostaphin), lysozyme, and bacteriophage endolysins. Bacteriophage are viruses that infect and utilize bacteria as their host. They can reside in the bacterial genome as a prophage, or enter the lytic phase, take over the bacterial gene expression machinery, synthesize new phage particles, lyse the host, and release up to hundreds of phage progeny. Lysis occurs during the late phase of the lytic cycle when the phage endolysin and a holin molecule are produced. The holin creates holes in the cells lipid bilayer allowing the phage endolysin (peptidoglycan hydrolase) to escape and degrade the structural portion of the cell wall. These (and other phage encoded proteins) have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth. The ability to inhibit growth or kill bacteria make both the bacteriophage and their gene products a rich source of potential antimicrobials. This review summarizes the recent resurgence of these potential antimicrobials as both diagnostic and therapeutic agents and identifies recent patents that describe these technologies.},

Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}) and nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis ({PCA}) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. {NMR} 1H and correlation spectroscopy ({COSY}) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp. {ZS}402 and Vibrio splendidus strain {LGP}32, to prioritize for scale-up based on their chemically interesting secondary metabolomes, established through dereplication and interesting bioactivities, determined from bioassay screening.},

	abstract = {Microbes produce a huge array of secondary metabolites endowed with important ecological functions. These molecules, which can be catalogued as natural products, have long been exploited in medical fields as antibiotics, anticancer and anti-infective agents. Recent years have seen considerable advances in elucidating natural-product biosynthesis and many drugs used today are natural products or natural-product derivatives. The major contribution to recent knowledge came from application of genomics to secondary metabolism and was facilitated by all relevant genes being organised in a contiguous {DNA} segment known as gene cluster. Clustering of genes regulating biosynthesis in bacteria is virtually universal. Modular gene clusters can be mixed and matched during evolution to generate structural diversity in natural products. Biosynthesis of many natural products requires the participation of complex molecular machines known as polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Discovery of new evolutionary links between the polyketide synthase and fatty acid synthase pathways may help to understand the selective advantages that led to evolution of secondary-metabolite biosynthesis within bacteria. Secondary metabolites confer selective advantages, either as antibiotics or by providing a chemical language that allows communication among species, with other organisms and their environment. Herewith, we discuss these aspects focusing on the most clinically relevant bioactive molecules, the thiotemplated modular systems that include polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and fatty acid synthases. We begin by describing the evolutionary and physiological role of marine natural products, their structural/functional features, mechanisms of action and biosynthesis, then turn to genomic and metagenomic approaches, highlighting how the growing body of information on microbial natural products can be used to address fundamental problems in environmental evolution and biotechnology.},

Many representatives of the order Actinomycetales are prolific producers of thousands of biologically active secondary metabolites. Among the actinobacteria, streptomycetes group are considered economically important because out of the approximately more than 10,000 known antibiotics, 50–55\% are produced by this genus. The ecological role of actinobacteria in the marine ecosystem is largely neglected and various assumptions meant there was little incentive to isolate marine strains for search and discovery of new drugs. The search for and discovery of novel actinobacteria are of significant interest to drug discovery due to a growing need for the development of new and potent therapeutic agents. In this review an evaluation is made on the present state of research on marine actinobacterial metabolites and its perspectives. The highlights include the production and biotechnological applications of metabolites such as antibiotics, anticancer compounds, melanins, enzymes and enzyme inhibitors, single cell protein and as probiotics in aquaculture. With increasing advancement in science and technology, there would be greater demands in future for new bioactive compounds synthesized by actinobacteria from various marine sources.},

Using (15){NH}(4)(+) incubations, nitrification was detectable in the upper water column down to 500 m; maximal rates were observed just below the euphotic zone. Crenarchaeal and betaproteobacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit A genes ({amoA}), and 16S ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) genes of Marine Group I Crenarchaeota and a putative nitrite-oxidizing genus, Nitrospina, were quantified using quantitative {PCR}. Crenarchaeal {amoA} abundance ranged from three to six genes ml(-1) in oligotrophic surface waters to {\textgreater} 8.7 x 10(4) genes ml(-1) just below the core of the California Current at 200 m depth. Bacterial {amoA} abundance was lower than archaeal {amoA} and ranged from below detection levels to 400 genes ml(-1). Nitrification rates were not directly correlated to bacterial or archaeal {amoA} abundance. Archaeal {amoA} and Marine Group I crenarchaeal 16S {rRNA} gene abundances were correlated with Nitrospina 16S {rRNA} gene abundance at all stations, indicating that similar factors may control the distribution of these two groups. Putatively shallow water-associated archaeal {amoA} types ('Cluster A') decreased in relative abundance with depth, while a deep water-associated {amoA} type ('Cluster B') increased with depth. Although some Cluster B {amoA} sequences were found in surface waters, expressed {amoA} gene sequences were predominantly from Cluster A. Cluster B {amoA} transcripts were detected between 100 and 500 m depths, suggesting an active role in ammonia oxidation in the mesopelagic. Expression of marine Nitrosospira-like bacterial {amoA} genes was detected throughout the euphotic zone down to 200 m. Natural abundance stable isotope ratios (delta(15)N and delta(18)O) in nitrate ({NO}(3)(-)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were used to evaluate the importance of nitrification over longer time scales. Using an isotope mass balance model, we calculate that nitrification could produce between 0.45 and 2.93 micromol m(-2) day(-1) N(2)O in the central California Current, or approximately 1.5-4 times the local N(2)O flux from deep water.},

Here we report the association of the colonial ascidian Cystodytes dellechiajei with putative ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaeota that could actively be involved in nitrification inside the animal tissue. As shown by 16S {rRNA} gene analysis, the ascidian-associated Crenarchaeota were phylogenetically related to Nitrosopumilus maritimus, the first marine archaeon isolated in pure culture that grows chemolithoautotrophically oxidizing ammonia to nitrite aerobically. Catalysed reporter deposition ({CARD})-{FISH} revealed that the Crenarchaeota were specifically located inside the tunic tissue of the colony, where moreover the expression of {amoA} gene was detected. The {amoA} gene encodes the alpha-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase, which is involved in the first step of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite. Sequencing of {amoA} gene showed that they were phylogenetically related to {amoA} genes of N. maritimus and other putative ammonia-oxidizing marine Crenarchaeota. In order to track the suspected nitrification activity inside the ascidian colony under in vivo conditions, microsensor profiles were measured through the tunic tissue. Net {NO}(x) production was detected in the tunic layer 1200-1800 microm with rates of 58-90 nmol cm(-3) h(-1). Oxygen and {pH} microsensor profiles showed that the layer of net {NO}(x) production coincided with O(2) concentrations of 103-116 {microM} and {pH} value of 5.2. Together, molecular and microsensor data indicate that Crenarchaeota could oxidize ammonia to nitrite aerobically, and thus be involved in nitrification inside the ascidian tissue.},

We used 16S {rRNA} gene tag pyrosequencing to provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial symbionts in the tunic of 42 Great Barrier Reef ascidian samples representing 25 species. Results revealed high bacterial biodiversity (3 217 unique operational taxonomic units ({OTU}0.03) from 19 described and 14 candidate phyla) and the widespread occurrence of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota in coral reef ascidians (24 of 25 host species). The ascidian microbiota was clearly differentiated from seawater microbial communities and included symbiont lineages shared with other invertebrate hosts as well as unique, ascidian-specific phylotypes. Several rare seawater microbes were markedly enriched (200–700 fold) in the ascidian tunic, suggesting that the rare biosphere of seawater may act as a conduit for horizontal symbiont transfer. However, most {OTUs} (71\%) were rare and specific to single hosts and a significant correlation between host relatedness and symbiont community similarity was detected, indicating a high degree of host-specificity and potential role of vertical transmission in structuring these communities. We hypothesize that the complex ascidian microbiota revealed herein is maintained by the dynamic microenvironments within the ascidian tunic, offering optimal conditions for different metabolic pathways such as ample chemical substrate (ammonia-rich host waste) and physical habitat (high oxygen, low irradiance) for nitrification. Thus, ascidian hosts provide unique and fertile niches for diverse microorganisms and may represent an important and previously unrecognized habitat for nitrite/nitrate regeneration in coral reef ecosystems.},

We aimed to elucidate the relative importance of host specificity and biogeographic background in shaping the symbiotic archaeal communities. We investigated these communities in sympatric sponges from the Mediterranean (Ircinia fasciculata and Ircinia oros, sampled in summer and winter) and from the Caribbean (Ircinia strobilina and Mycale laxissima). {PCR} cloning and sequencing of archaeal 16S {rRNA} and {amoA} genes showed that the archaeal community composition and structure were different from that in seawater and varied among sponge species. We found that the communities were dominated by ammonia-oxidizing archaea closely related to Nitrosopumilus. The community in M. laxissima differed from that in Ircinia spp., including the sympatric sponge I. strobilina; yet, geographical clusters within Ircinia spp. were observed. Whereas archaeal phylotypes in Ircinia spp. were persistent and belong to ‘sponge-enriched’ clusters, archaea in M. laxissima were closely related with those from diverse habitats (i.e. seawater and sediments). For all four sponge species, the expression of the archaeal {amoA} gene was confirmed. Our results indicate that host-specific processes, such as host ecological strategy and evolutionary history, control the sponge–archaeal communities.},

This review describes the structure of secondary modifications and of attachment sites of surface polymers in the glycan strands of peptidoglycan.

Recently, enzymes responsible for the N-deacetylation, N-glycolylation and O-acetylation of the glycan strands were identified. The presence of these modifications affects the hydrolysis of peptidoglycan and its enlargement during cell growth. Glycan strands are frequently deacetylated and/or O-acetylated in pathogenic species. These alterations affect the recognition of bacteria by host factors, and contribute to the resistance of bacteria to host defence factors such as lysozyme.},

	abstract = {A general approach for the detailed characterization of sodium borohydride-reduced peptidoglycan fragments (syn. muropeptides), produced by muramidase digestion of the purified sacculus isolated from Bacillus subtilis (vegetative cell form of the wild type and a {dacA} mutant) and Bacillus megaterium (endospore form), is outlined based on {UV} matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ({MALDI}-{TOF}) and nano-electrospray ionization ({nESI}) quadrupole ion trap ({QIT}) mass spectrometry ({MS}). After enzymatic digestion and reduction of the resulting muropeptides, the complex glycopeptide mixture was separated and fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, the muropeptide samples were subjected to a desalting step and an aliquot was taken for amino acid analysis. Initial molecular mass determination of these peptidoglycan fragments (ranging from monomeric to tetrameric muropeptides) was performed by positive and negative ion {MALDI}-{MS} using the thin-layer technique with the matrix alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The results demonstrated that for the fast molecular mass determination of large sample numbers in the 0.8-10 pmol range and with a mass accuracy of +/-0.07\%, negative ion {MALDI}-{MS} in the linear {TOF} mode is the method of choice. After this kind of muropeptide screening often a detailed primary structural analysis is required owing to ambiguous data. Structural data could be obtained from peptidoglycan monomers by post-source decay ({PSD}) fragment ion analysis, but not from dimers or higher oligomers and not with the necessary sensitivity. Multistage collision-induced dissociation ({CID}) experiments performed on an {nESI}-{QIT} instrument were found to be the superior method for structural characterization of not only monomeric but also of dimeric and trimeric muropeptides. Up to {MS}4 experiments were sometimes necessary to obtain unambiguous structural information. Three examples are presented: (a) {CID} {MSn} (n = 2-4) of a peptidoglycan monomer (disaccharide-tripeptide) isolated from B. subtilis (wild type, vegetative cell form), (b) {CID} {MSn} (n = 2-4) of a peptidoglycan dimer (bis-disaccharide-tetrapentapeptide) obtained from a B. subtilis mutant (vegetative cell form) and (c) {CID} {MS}2 of a peptidoglycan trimer (a linear hexasaccharide with two peptide side chains) isolated from the spore cortex of B. megaterium. All {MS}(n) experiments were performed on singly charged precursor ions and the {MS}2 spectra were dominated by fragments derived from interglycosidic bond cleavages. {MS}3 and {MS}4 spectra exhibited mainly peptide moiety fragment ions. In case of the bis-disaccharide-tetrapentapeptide, the peptide branching point could be determined based on {MS}3 and {MS}4 spectra. The results demonstrate the utility of {nESI}-{QIT}-{MS} towards the facile determination of the glycan sequence, the peptide linkage and the peptide sequence and branching of purified muropeptides (monomeric up to trimeric forms). The wealth of structural information generated by {nESI}-{QIT}-{MSn} is unsurpassed by any other individual technique.},

Some of these bacterial enzymes are crucial for bacterial pathogenicity and have been shown to modulate muropeptide release and/or host innate immune responses. The ability of muropeptides to modulate host responses is due to the fact that eukaryotes do not produce {PGN} and have instead evolved numerous strategies to detect intact {PGN} and {PGN} fragments (muropeptides). Here we review the structure of {PGN} and introduce the various bacterial enzymes known to degrade or modify bacterial {PGN}. Host factors involved in {PGN} and muropeptide detection are also briefly discussed, as are examples of how specific bacterial pathogens use {PGN} degradation and modification to subvert host innate immunity.},

In the present study, hydrolyzable amino sugars were measured in a variety of marine organisms and particulate organic matter ({POM}) and in ultrafiltered dissolved organic matter ({UDOM}) from various ocean basins and depths. Glucosamine ({GlcN}) and galactosamine ({GalN}) were abundant and common to all samples. Concentrations of these two amino sugars were similar to their neutral sugar counterparts, glucose and galactose, and in surface water they accounted for up to {\textasciitilde}1.5\% of C and N in {POM} and 2.5\% of C and 7.1\% of N in {UDOM}. Chitin, a polymer of glucosamine, is produced by many marine organisms, but based on the low {GlcN} : {GalN} ratios (1.0–2.5) in {POM} and {UDOM}, it does not appear to be a primary source of glucosamine in these samples. Muramic acid, an amino sugar found only in the bacterial cell wall polymer peptidoglycan, was relatively abundant in {POM}, indicating that bacterial detritus is a principal component of submicron particles in seawater. Muramic acid was measured in all {UDOM} samples, but its concentrations were low ({\textless}1 nmol L−1), indicating that intact fragments of peptidoglycan were a relatively minor component of {UDOM}. The abundance of {GlcN} and {GalN} and their similar concentrations in {POM} and {UDOM} provide novel information suggesting a major prokaryotic source.},

Recent chemical analysis of particulate organic matter suggests that a major amount of the muramic acid, an amino sugar present only in {PG}, could not be accounted for in terms of bacterial cells (Benner and Kaiser, 2003); however, data on particulate {PG} is quite sparse. In the present study, conducted in 1996, the {PG} was examined at 5 sampling sites in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and in natural seawater cultures. Particulate {PG}, which was concentrated using a 96-well filtration plate equipped with Durapore filters (pore size, 0.22 μm), was measured by the silkworm larvae plasma ({SLP}) assay. The {PG} concentration generally decreased with depth and correlated significantly with bacterial abundance throughout the entire water column. However, the ratio of particulate {PG} to bacterial abundance varied with depth. The average ratio was 0.61 ± 0.53 (average ± {SD}, n = 40) between 50 and 2000 m, which agreed with the bacterial cellular {PG} content from 0.63 to 1.1 fg cell−1 obtained in seawater cultures. On the other hand, the ratios of {PG} to bacteria from the surface to 50 m (3.7 ± 2.6, n = 29) and below 2,000 m (2.1 ± 1.7, n = 7) were significantly higher than that between 50 and 2,000 m. These results may suggest that, in the surface and deep layers, a significant fraction of particulate {PG} was present in bacterial detritus, whereas this fraction was reduced in the middle layer.},

However, little is known about how host metabolites may defend against harmful microbes or facilitate the growth or colonization of helpful symbionts. While there is a large body of literature describing the antimicrobial activities of marine secondary metabolites, we are only now beginning to understand how these compounds function in an ecological context. For example, there is mounting evidence that nontoxic concentrations of secondary metabolites can have significant effects on microbial behavior, suggesting that certain host-microbe interactions are chemically mediated. Herein, we discuss the importance of employing ecologically relevant assays to elucidate microbiological effects and the need to develop a better understanding of host-microbe associations within an ecologically realistic context.

	abstract = {* Marine organisms are a prolific source of natural products, many of which have become the target of pharmacological investigations. As well as being bioactive, these compounds can play an important role in the survival of the organisms and potentially affect community structure. Sessile invertebrates such as sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans and tunicates, in particular, are an especially rich source of ecologically relevant compounds. These organisms are typically soft-bodied and unable to escape predators, and as such, they rely on chemical defence for their persistence. These invertebrates are also frequently hosts for microbial symbionts.


* Marine microbes are a prolific source of bioactive natural products, many of which can be allelopathic and prevent the growth of pathogens. For sessile marine invertebrates, which often have both bioactive natural products and microbial symbionts, it is logical to hypothesize that microbial symbionts may produce the secondary metabolites.


* While symbionts are often thought to be responsible for producing bioactive natural products that play a role in host defence, relatively few studies have experimentally demonstrated that symbiont-produced compounds defend the hosts. One reason for this is the difficulty of manipulating the host–symbiont relationship, which is often obligate for one or both partners. Given the importance of natural products to marine invertebrates for defence, the prevalence of symbiosis in the marine environment and the diverse metabolic capabilities of micro-organisms, symbiont-mediated host chemical defence may be more prevalent than currently understood.


* In this review, I document evidence supporting chemical defensive symbioses in marine organisms, discuss commonalities and differences among the diverse relationships, and provide future research directions. Epibiont-produced defensive compounds would seem to result in the most efficient manner of protection, as the compounds are most accessible to the predators. By contrast, endosymbiont-produced compounds may need to be transported to exposed tissues. Elucidating mechanisms to transport symbiont-produced defensive compounds within the host will provide greater insight into the breadth and complexity of host–symbiont interactions. Another important unexplored issue is how the hosts are able to tolerate symbiont-produced metabolites that are often eucaryotic cell effectors. A greater understanding of defensive symbiosis will result from detailed studies of the co-evolution of predator, host and symbiont, and if or how predators can influence the production of defensive metabolites.},

Six different sponges were collected and they were identified on the basis of their morphology. The drug-producing isolates were screened by agar overlay method towards various clinical strains. The secondary metabolites were characterized and were found to be quinones, alkaloids, flavanoids and flavonyl glycosides. The metabolites showed significant inhibitory properties against clinical strains that were further identified as chromophoric and fluorophoric in nature. Ethyl acetate extracts of chromophore and floureophore substances showed significant inhibitory properties against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ({MRSA}) and Salmonella typhi respectively. 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing of theses isolates revealed that chomophore-producing strain were closely related to Pseudomonas spp. {RHLB}12, isolated from Callyspongia spp. and floureophore-producing bacteria was related to Bacillus licheniformis T6-1 which was isolated from Haliclona spp. Hence, our study demonstrated that antimicrobial metabolites extracted from symbiotic bacteria associated with marine sponges have high therapeutic potential against many bacterial pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {AND} {IMPACT} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: This is the first study demonstrating antimicrobial potential of flurophoric and chromophoric metabolites extracted from bacterial biosymbionts associated with marine sponges. Our study has significant scope as Indian coastal area especially harbours vast varieties of sponges with novel secondary metabolites-producing organisms. The natural metabolites extracted from sponge-derived bacteria pave novel therapeutic remedy against various pathogens when most of them are emerged as extreme drug resistant superbugs.},

Based on enrichment cultures, we report that archaeal ammonia oxidation also produces N(2)O. Natural-abundance stable isotope measurements indicate that the produced N(2)O had bulk δ(15)N and δ(18)O values higher than observed for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but similar to the δ(15)N and δ(18)O values attributed to the oceanic N(2)O source to the atmosphere.

We have studied Archaea from 200-m depths of the northwest Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean near California, measuring the archaeal activity under simulated natural conditions (8 to 17°C, dark and anaerobic) by means of a method called substrate tracking autoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridization ({STARFISH}) that simultaneously detects specific cell types by 16S {rRNA} probe binding and activity by microautoradiography. In the 200-m-deep Mediterranean and Pacific samples, cells binding the archaeal probes made up about 43 and 14\% of the total countable cells, respectively. Our results showed that the Archaea are active in the uptake of dissolved amino acids from natural concentrations (nanomolar) with about 60\% of the individuals in the archaeal communities showing measurable uptake. Bacteria showed a similar proportion of active cells. We concluded that a portion of these Archaea is heterotrophic and also appears to coexist successfully with Bacteria in the same water.},

But quantitative data on the abundance of specific microbial groups in the deep sea are lacking. Here we report a year-long study of the abundance of two specific archaeal groups (pelagic euryarchaeota and pelagic crenarchaeota) in one of the ocean's largest habitats. Monthly sampling was conducted throughout the water column (surface to 4,750 m) at the Hawai'i Ocean Time-series station. Below the euphotic zone ({\textgreater} 150 m), pelagic crenarchaeota comprised a large fraction of total marine picoplankton, equivalent in cell numbers to bacteria at depths greater than 1,000 m. The fraction of crenarchaeota increased with depth, reaching 39\% of total {DNA}-containing picoplankton detected. The average sum of archaea plus bacteria detected by {rRNA}-targeted fluorescent probes ranged from 63 to 90\% of total cell numbers at all depths throughout our survey. The high proportion of cells containing significant amounts of {rRNA} suggests that most pelagic deep-sea microorganisms are metabolically active. Furthermore, our results suggest that the global oceans harbour approximately 1.3 1028 archaeal cells, and 3.1 10 28 bacterial cells. Our data suggest that pelagic crenarchaeota represent one of the ocean's single most abundant cell types.},

Despite severe conditions and significant decreases in microbial abundance, no significant changes in richness or community structure were detected in the ice. Communities of Bacteria and Archaea in the ice, as in under-ice seawater, were dominated by {SAR}11 clade Alphaproteobacteria and Marine Group I Crenarchaeota, neither of which is known from later season sea ice. The bacterial ice library contained clones of Gammaproteobacteria from oligotrophic seawater clades (e.g. {OM}60, {OM}182) but no clones from gammaproteobacterial genera commonly detected in later season sea ice by similar methods (e.g. Colwellia, Psychrobacter).

Microbial communities in the water column were analyzed from four diverse habitats: (1) an estuarine turbidity maximum ({ETM}), (2) a chlorophyll maximum of the river plume, (3) an upwelling-associated hypoxic zone, and (4) the deep ocean bottom. Three size fractions, 0.1–0.8, 0.8–3, and 3–200 μm were collected for each habitat in August 2007, and used for {DNA} isolation and 454 sequencing, resulting in 12 metagenomes of {\textgreater}5 million reads ({\textgreater}1.6 Gbp). To characterize the dominant microorganisms and metabolisms contributing to coastal biogeochemistry, we used predicted peptide and {rRNA} data. The 3- and 0.8-μm metagenomes, representing particulate fractions, were taxonomically diverse across habitats. The 3-μm size fractions contained a high abundance of eukaryota with diatoms dominating the hypoxic water and plume, while cryptophytes were more abundant in the {ETM}. The 0.1-μm metagenomes represented mainly free-living bacteria and archaea. The most abundant archaeal hits were observed in the deep ocean and hypoxic water (19\% of prokaryotic peptides in the 0.1-μm metagenomes), and were homologous to Nitrosopumilus maritimus (ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota). Bacteria dominated metagenomes of all samples. In the euphotic zone (estuary, plume and hypoxic ocean), the most abundant bacterial taxa (≥40\% of prokaryotic peptides) represented aerobic photoheterotrophs. In contrast, the low-oxygen, deep water metagenome was enriched with sequences for strict and facultative anaerobes. Interestingly, many of the same anaerobic bacterial families were enriched in the 3-μm size fraction of the {ETM} (2–10X more abundant relative to the 0.1-μm metagenome), indicating possible formation of anoxic microniches within particles. Results from this study provide a metagenome perspective on ecosystem-scale metabolism in an upwelling-influenced river-dominated coastal margin.},

To learn more about {POM}-associated microbial communities in cold waters, we worked aboard the icebreaker ‘Kapitan Dranitsyn’ during the Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System ({NABOS}) 2005 cruise to the Laptev Sea, a river-impacted region in the Siberian Arctic, to sample 3 size fractions of particles operationally defined as sinking aggregates ({\textgreater}60 µm), smaller suspended particles (1 to 60 µm), and free-living bacteria (0.22 to 1 µm). Sample temperatures and depths ranged from –1.6 to 1.5°C and 25 to 150 m, respectively. Analysis of associated microbial communities using 16S {rRNA} gene-based clone libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-{RFLP}) indicated greatest diversity and richness in the smaller size fractions and significantly different communities in the aggregate fraction for both Bacteria and Archaea. The most abundant clones in the Bacterial libraries were Gammaproteobacteria, followed by members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides ({CFB}) group and Alphaproteobacteria; the Archaeal libraries contained primarily Marine Group I Crenarchaeota. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that Bacterial communities, especially those associated with aggregates, were influenced by riverine input and temperature. Determinants of Archaeal communities were less clear, but temperature appeared important. Distinctions in Bacterial and Archaeal community complexity observed among the different particle size classes suggest the importance of particle residence time in structuring associated microbial communities and defining their biogeochemical roles.},

In this study, we used particle interceptor traps ({PITs}) to assess the nature of particle-associated microbial communities collected at a variety of depths in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Comparative metagenomics was used to assess differences in microbial taxa and functional gene repertoires in {PITs} containing a preservative (poisoned traps) compared to preservative-free traps where growth was allowed to continue in situ (live traps). Live trap microbial communities shared taxonomic and functional similarities with bacteria previously reported to be enriched in dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) microcosms (e.g., Alteromonas and Methylophaga), in addition to other particle and eukaryote-associated bacteria (e.g., Flavobacteriales and Pseudoalteromonas). Poisoned trap microbial assemblages were enriched in Vibrio and Campylobacterales likely associated with eukaryotic surfaces and intestinal tracts as symbionts, pathogens, or saprophytes. The functional gene content of microbial assemblages in poisoned traps included a variety of genes involved in virulence, anaerobic metabolism, attachment to chitinaceaous surfaces, and chitin degradation. The presence of chitinaceaous surfaces was also accompanied by the co-existence of bacteria which encoded the capacity to attach to, transport and metabolize chitin and its derivatives. Distinctly different microbial assemblages predominated in live traps, which were largely represented by copiotrophs and eukaryote-associated bacterial communities. Predominant sediment trap-assocaited eukaryotic phyla included Dinoflagellata, Metazoa (mostly copepods), Protalveolata, Retaria, and Stramenopiles. These data indicate the central role of eukaryotic taxa in structuring sinking particle microbial assemblages, as well as the rapid responses of indigenous microbial species in the degradation of marine particulate organic matter ({POM}) in situ in the ocean's interior.},

	abstract = {The oxidation of methane in anoxic marine sediments is thought to be mediated by a consortium of methane-consuming archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. In this study, we compared results of {rRNA} gene ({rDNA}) surveys and lipid analyses of archaea and bacteria associated with methane seep sediments from several different sites on the Californian continental margin. Two distinct archaeal lineages ({ANME}-1 and {ANME}-2), peripherally related to the {orderMethanosarcinales}, were consistently associated with methane seep marine sediments. The same sediments contained abundant13C-depleted archaeal lipids, indicating that one or both of these archaeal groups are members of anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia. 13C-depleted lipids and the signature 16S {rDNAs} for these archaeal groups were absent in nearby control sediments. Concurrent surveys of bacterial {rDNAs} revealed a predominance of δ-proteobacteria, in particular, close relatives {ofDesulfosarcina} variabilis. Biomarker analyses of the same sediments showed bacterial fatty acids with strong 13C depletion that are likely products of these sulfate-reducing bacteria. Consistent with these observations, whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed aggregations of {ANME}-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfosarcina {andDesulfococcus} species. Additionally, the presence of abundant 13C-depleted ether lipids, presumed to be of bacterial origin but unrelated to ether lipids of members of the {orderDesulfosarcinales}, suggests the participation of additional bacterial groups in the methane-oxidizing process. Although {theDesulfosarcinales} and {ANME}-2 consortia appear to participate in the anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine sediments, our data suggest that other bacteria and archaea are also involved in methane oxidation in these environments.},

hopanols, and C 40 isoprenoid side chains from the

small amount of benthic incorporation of 14C-depleted
dissolved inorganic carbon was identified for the bacterial hopanols and
C 15 linear and branched-chain fatty acids. However, there is
no apparent uptake of 14C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon
in Santa Monica Basin by the bacteria, including filamentous Beggiatoa

lipid classes did not reflect carbon originally fixed by marine
photoautotrophs. These were the n-alkanes, for which the Δ

A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.},

The substrate driven, hinge bending motions of lysozyme induced dynamic electronic signals in the underlying transistor, allowing long-term monitoring of the same molecule without the limitations of optical quenching or bleaching. For both substrates, lysozyme exhibits processive slow turnover rates of 20 – 50 s−1 and rapid 200 – 400 s−1 non-productive motions. The latter, nonproductive binding events occupy 43\% of the enzyme’s time in the presence of the cross-linked peptidoglycan, but only 7\% with the linear substrate. Furthermore, lysozyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds to the end of the linear substrate, but appears to sidestep the peptide cross-links to zigzag through the wild-type substrate.},

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that a widely distributed and uncultivated microbial group—the marine group {II} euryarchaea ({MGII})—interacts with living and detrital particulate organic matter ({POM}) in the euphotic zone of the central California Current System. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we verified the association of euryarchaea with {POM}. We further quantified the abundance and distribution of {MGII} 16 S ribosomal {RNA} genes in size-fractionated seawater samples and compared {MGII} functional capacity in metagenomes from the same fractions. The abundance of {MGII} in free-living and {\textgreater}3 μm fractions decreased with increasing distance from the coast, whereas {MGII} abundance in the 0.8–3 μm fraction remained constant. At several offshore sites, {MGII} abundance was highest in particle fractions, indicating that particle-attached {MGII} can outnumber free-living {MGII} under oligotrophic conditions. Compared with free-living {MGII}, the genome content of {MGII} in particle-associated fractions exhibits an increased capacity for surface adhesion, transcriptional regulation and catabolism of high molecular weight substrates. Moreover, {MGII} populations in {POM} fractions are phylogenetically distinct from and more diverse than free-living {MGII}. Eukaryotic phytoplankton additions stimulated {MGII} growth in bottle incubations, providing the first {MGII} net growth rate measurements. These ranged from 0.47 to 0.54 d−1. However, {MGII} were not recovered in whole-genome amplifications of flow-sorted picoeukaryotic phytoplankton and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, suggesting that {MGII} in particle fractions are not physically attached to living {POM}. Collectively, our results support a linkage between {MGII} ecophysiology and {POM}, implying that marine archaea have a role in elemental cycling through interactions with particles.},

Ribosomal {RNA} surveys have identified four major clades of planktonic archaea but, to date, tetraether lipids have been characterized in only one, the Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota. The membrane lipid composition of the other planktonic archaeal groups—all uncultured Euryarchaeota—is currently unknown. Using integrated nucleic acid and lipid analyses, we found that Marine Group {II} Euryarchaeota ({MG}-{II}) contributed significantly to the tetraether lipid pool in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre at shallow to intermediate depths. Our data strongly suggested that {MG}-{II} also synthesize crenarchaeol, a tetraether lipid previously considered to be a unique biomarker for Thaumarchaeota. Metagenomic datasets spanning 5 y indicated that depth stratification of planktonic archaeal groups was a stable feature in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The consistent prevalence of {MG}-{II} at depths where the bulk of exported organic matter originates, together with their ubiquitous distribution over diverse oceanic provinces, suggests that this clade is a significant source of tetraether lipids to marine sediments. Our results are relevant to archaeal lipid biomarker applications in the modern oceans and the interpretation of these compounds in the geologic record.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Glycerol-based alkyl ether lipids are ubiquitous components in marine sediments. In order to explore their structural diversity and biological sources, marine sediment samples from diverse environments were analyzed and the mass spectra of widely distributed, novel glycerol di- and tetraethers were examined systematically.
{METHODS}: Lipid extracts of twelve globally distributed marine subsurface sediments were analyzed by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry ({APCI}-{MS}). Tandem mass ({MS}/{MS}) spectra of compounds were obtained with a quadrupole time-of-flight ({qTOF}) mass spectrometer.
{RESULTS}: In addition to the well-established isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (isoprenoidal {GDGT}) and branched {GDGT}, suites of novel lipids were detected in all studied samples. These lipids include the following classes of tentatively identified compounds: isoprenoidal glycerol dialkanol diether (isoprenoidal {GDD}), hydroxylated isoprenoidal {GDGT} ({OH}-{GDGT}), hybrid isoprenoidal/branched {GDGT} ({IB}-{GDGT}), hydroxylated isoprenoidal {GDD} ({OH}-{GDD}), overly branched {GDGT} ({OB}-{GDGT}), sparsely branched {GDGT} ({SB}-{GDGT}) and an abundant H-shaped {GDGT} with the [M+H](+) ion of m/z 1020 (H-1020).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Characteristic {MS}/{MS} fragmentation patterns provided mass spectral 'fingerprints' for the recognition of diverse and prominent glycerol ether lipids. The ubiquitous distribution and substantial abundance of these glycerol ethers, as well as their structural variability, suggest a significant ecological role of their source organisms in various marine environments.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Studies of archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers ({GDGTs}) in the environment and cultures have exclusively focused on compounds with fully saturated alkyl moieties. Here we report a number of novel unsaturated {GDGTs} (uns-{GDGTs}) whose alkyl chains contain up to six double bonds and zero to two cyclopentyl moieties.
{METHODS}: The identification of these lipids was achieved via comparison of lipid distribution before and after hydrogenation, characteristic retention time patterns, and diagnostic ions using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}/{MS}), and ether cleavage products using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}). Isomerism resulting from different unsaturation patterns in the alkyl moieties was observed and specific positions of double bonds in the biphytene and biphytadiene moieties were tentatively assigned.
{RESULTS}: Uns-{GDGTs} were detected in sediment and microbial mat samples as both core lipids ({CLs}) and intact polar lipids ({IPLs}) associated with mono- or diglycosyl or phosphatidylglycerol headgroups. However, these lipids were overlooked in past investigations because conventional methods for archaeal lipid analysis are unsuitable for uns-{GDGTs}. Samples from distinct marine environments (Black Sea, Cariaco Basin, Discovery Basin, Eastern Mediterranean Sea, upwelling area off {NW} Africa, and seep sites off Crimea and Pakistan) were screened for uns-{GDGTs} using a new {LC}/{MS} protocol. The results show that uns-{GDGTs} contribute significantly to the archaeal lipid pool in anoxic methane-rich environments (Black Sea, Cariaco Basin, and both seep sites) but they were barely detected in the oxic or hypersaline settings.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The characteristic distribution of uns-{GDGTs} implies that they are attractive targets for future studies aiming at the chemotaxonomy of uncultivated archaea and regulation of uns-{GDGT} biosynthesis.},

In order to validate sedimentary biosynthesis of 2G-{GDGTs}, we performed a stable carbon isotope probing experiment on a subseafloor sample with six different (13) C-labelled substrates (bicarbonate, methane, acetate, leucine, glucose and Spirulina platensis biomass). After 468 days of anoxic incubation, only glucose and S. platensis resulted in label uptake in lipid moieties of 2G-{GDGTs}, indicating incorporation of carbon from these organic substrates. The hydrophobic moieties of 2G-{GDGTs} showed minimal label incorporation, with up to 4‰ (13) C enrichment detected in crenarchaeol-derived tricyclic biphytane from the S. platensis-supplemented slurries. The 2G-{GDGT}-derived glucose or glycerol moieties also showed (13) C incorporation (Δδ(13) C = 18-38‰) in the incubations with glucose or S. platensis, consistent with a lipid salvage mechanism utilized by marine benthic archaea to produce new 2G-{GDGTs}. The production rates were nevertheless rather slow, even when labile organic matter was supplied. The 2G-{GDGT} turnover times of 1700-20,500 years were much longer than those estimated for subseafloor microbial communities, implying that sedimentary 2G-{GDGTs} as biomarkers of benthic archaea are cumulative records of past and present generations.},

While core {GDGTs} (formed by hydrolysis of polar head groups of intact {GDGTs} after cell death) are appropriate for paleostudies, they have also been used to trace archaeal populations. Also, despite the small size (0.2 by 0.7 μm) of cultivated marine archaea, 0.7-μm glass-fiber filters ({GFFs}) are typically used to collect {GDGTs} from natural waters. We quantified both core and intact {GDGTs} in free-living (0.2- to 0.7-μm), suspended (0.7- to 60-μm), and aggregate ({\textgreater}60-μm) particle size fractions in Puget Sound (Washington State). On average, the free-living fraction contained 36\% of total {GDGTs}, 90\% of which were intact. The intermediate-size fraction contained 62\% of {GDGTs}, and 29\% of these were intact. The aggregate fraction contained 2\% of the total {GDGT} pool, and 29\% of these were intact. Our results demonstrate that intact {GDGTs} are largely in the free-living fraction. Because only intact {GDGTs} are present in living cells, protocols that target this size fraction and analyze the intact {GDGT} pool are necessary to track living populations in marine waters. Core {GDGT} enrichment in larger-size fractions indicates that archaeal biomass may quickly become attached or entrained in particles once the archaea are dead or dying. While the concentrations of the two pools were generally not correlated, the similar sizes of the core and intact {GDGT} pools suggest that core {GDGTs} are removed from the water column on timescales similar to those of cell replication, on timescales of days to weeks.},

	abstract = {Large quantities of natural gas are emitted from the seafloor into the stratified coastal ocean near Coal Oil Point, Santa Barbara Channel, California. Methane was quantified in the down current surface water at 79 stations in a 280 km2 study area. The methane plume spread over an area of ∼70 km2 and emitted on the order of 5 × 104 mol d−1 to the atmosphere. A monthly time series at 14 stations showed variable methane concentrations which were correlated with changing sub-mesoscale surface currents. Air-sea fluxes estimated from the time series indicate that the air-sea flux derived for the 280 km2 area is representative of the daily mean flux from this area. Only 1\% of the dissolved methane originating from Coal Oil Point enters the atmosphere within the study area. Most of it appears to be transported below the surface and oxidized by microbial activity.},

In this paper, six methanogenic substrates are tested as candidate-{IECs} by assessing their effect on {AOM} and {SR} by an anaerobic methanotrophic enrichment. The presence of acetate, formate or hydrogen enhanced {SR}, but did not inhibit {AOM}, nor did these substrates trigger methanogenesis. Carbon monoxide also enhanced {SR} but slightly inhibited {AOM}. Methanol did not enhance {SR} nor did it inhibit {AOM}, and methanethiol inhibited both {SR} and {AOM} completely. Subsequently, it was calculated at which candidate-{IEC} concentrations no more Gibbs free energy can be conserved from their production from methane at the applied conditions. These concentrations were at least 1,000 times lower can the final candidate-{IEC} concentration in the bulk liquid. Therefore, the tested candidate-{IECs} could not have been produced from methane during the incubations. Hence, acetate, formate, methanol, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen can be excluded as sole {IEC} in {AOM} coupled to {SR}. Methanethiol did inhibit {AOM} and can therefore not be excluded as {IEC} by this study.},

The author is a geologist who has spent much of his life investigating the climate of Earth from a time when it was warm and dinosaurs roamed the land, to today's changing climate. Bill Hay takes you on a journey to understand how the climate system works. He explores how humans are unintentionally conducting a grand uncontrolled experiment which is leading to unanticipated changes. We follow the twisting path of seemingly unrelated discoveries in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and even mathematics to learn how they led to our present knowledge of how our planet works. He explains why the weather is becoming increasingly chaotic as our planet warms at a rate far faster than at any time in its geologic past. He speculates on possible future outcomes, and suggests that nature itself may make some unexpected course corrections. Although the book is written for the layman with little knowledge of science or mathematics, it includes information from many diverse fields to provide even those actively working in the field of climatology with a broader view of this developing drama. Experimenting on a Small Planet is a must read for anyone having more than a casual interest in global warming and climate change - one of the most important and challenging issues of our time.},

Global methane flux from seabed cold seeps has only been estimated for continental shelves, at 8 to 65 Tg {CH}4 yr−1, yet other parts of marine continental margins are also emitting methane. The {US} Atlantic margin has not been considered an area of widespread seepage, with only three methane seeps recognized seaward of the shelf break. However, massive upper-slope seepage related to gas hydrate degradation has been predicted for the southern part of this margin, even though this process has previously only been recognized in the Arctic. Here we use multibeam water-column backscatter data that cover 94,000 km2 of sea floor to identify about 570 gas plumes at water depths between 50 and 1,700 m between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank on the northern {US} Atlantic passive margin. About 440 seeps originate at water depths that bracket the updip limit for methane hydrate stability. Contemporary upper-slope seepage there may be triggered by ongoing warming of intermediate waters, but authigenic carbonates observed imply that emissions have continued for more than 1,000 years at some seeps. Extrapolating the upper-slope seep density on this margin to the global passive margin system, we suggest that tens of thousands of seeps could be discoverable.},

	abstract = {Methane frozen into hydrate makes up a large reservoir of potentially volatile carbon below the sea floor and associated with permafrost soils. This reservoir intuitively seems precarious, because hydrate ice floats in water, and melts at Earth surface conditions. The hydrate reservoir is so large that if 10\% of the methane were released to the atmosphere within a few years, it would have an impact on the Earth's radiation budget equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in atmospheric {CO}2.

 Hydrates are releasing methane to the atmosphere today in response to anthropogenic warming, for example along the Arctic coastline of Siberia. However most of the hydrates are located at depths in soils and ocean sediments where anthropogenic warming and any possible methane release will take place over time scales of millennia. Individual catastrophic releases like landslides and pockmark explosions are too small to reach a sizable fraction of the hydrates. The carbon isotopic excursion at the end of the Paleocene has been interpreted as the release of thousands of Gton C, possibly from hydrates, but the time scale of the release appears to have been thousands of years, chronic rather than catastrophic.

 The potential climate impact in the coming century from hydrate methane release is speculative but could be comparable to climate feedbacks from the terrestrial biosphere and from peat, significant but not catastrophic. On geologic timescales, it is conceivable that hydrates could release as much carbon to the atmosphere/ocean system as we do by fossil fuel combustion.},

	abstract = {Buffett and Archer (2004) showed a model of the steady state global ocean clathrate reservoir that reproduces drill data and predicts a global methane inventory of about 5000 Gton C. The model inventory is very sensitive to ocean temperature, with factor-of-two changes in methane inventory in response to temperature changes of 1.5°C. Here we explore the potential time-dependent behavior of the clathrate reservoir, assuming simple first-order rate constants for methane accumulation and meltdown in response to changes in the predicted steady state reservoir. For melting, we divide the reservoir into two parts, one melting catastrophically and the other slowly. Evolution of clathrates through geologic time is very sensitive to the choice of these rate constants. A positive feedback exists during a transient meltdown event, stronger if the catastrophic-melting fraction is high and its melting timescale is fast. A clathrate reservoir governed by such kinetics would melt down periodically, on a multimillion-year timescale determined by the rate constant for clathrate accumulation. Ideally, we would like a model that predicts runaway melting in the Paleocene and stability in the Pleistocene. However, the model is most unstable when climate is cold, rather than warm. Opting for stability in the Pleistocene constrains the melting kinetic parameters, leaving one degree of freedom. The grow-in timescale must be 5 Myr or longer, to get the deglacial δ13C right, but shorter than 10 Myr, in order for clathrates to have built up through geologically recent cooling. The model thus constrained predicts methane fluxes of 200 Gton C or less on deglaciations, but eventual releases of 2000–4000 Gton C in response to a ∼2000 Gton C anthropogenic carbon release. Anthropogenic climate change differs from a deglaciation in that it warms the ocean to temperatures not seen in millions of years.},

The visible hydrate was found as thin icelike layers that released methane gas initially upon retrieval, but stabilized for up to 4 h at atmospheric pressure conditions and subfreezing temperatures. The temporary stabilization of hydrate samples is attributed to the self-preservation phenomenon described by others on the basis of laboratory studies. High methane concentrations in well-ice-bonded sediments and gas releases suggest that pore-space hydrate may be found at depths as shallow as 119 m. Geochemical and isotopic determinations suggest that the methane hydrate observed in the core hole is biogenic (microbial) in origin.},

The stability of marine hydrates is sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure and once destabilised, hydrates release methane into sediments and ocean and potentially into the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback with climate change. Here we present results from a multi-model study investigating how the methane hydrate inventory dynamically responds to different scenarios of future climate and sea level change. The results indicate that a warming-induced reduction is dominant even when assuming rather extreme rates of sea level rise (up to 20 mm yr−1) under moderate warming scenarios ({RCP} 4.5). Over the next century modelled hydrate dissociation is focussed in the top ∼ 100 m of Arctic and Subarctic sediments beneath \&lt; 500 m water depth. Predicted dissociation rates are particularly sensitive to the modelled vertical hydrate distribution within sediments. Under the worst case business-as-usual scenario ({RCP} 8.5), upper estimates of resulting global sea-floor methane fluxes could exceed estimates of natural global fluxes by 2100 ( \&gt; 30 – 50 Tg {CH} 4 yr − 1 ) , although subsequent oxidation in the water column could reduce peak atmospheric release rates to 0.75–1.4 Tg {CH}4 yr−1.},

The methane “clumped-isotope geothermometer”, based on the measurement of multiply substituted methane isotopologues (13CH3D and 12CH2D2), shows promise in adding new constraints to the sources and formational environments of both biogenic and thermogenic methane. However, questions remain about how this geothermometer behaves in systems with mixtures of biogenic and thermogenic gases and different biogenic environments. We have applied the methane clumped-isotope thermometer to a mixed biogenic–thermogenic system (Antrim Shale, {USA}) and to biogenic gas from gas seeps (Santa Barbara and Santa Monica Basin, {USA}), a pond on the Caltech campus, and methanogens grown in pure culture. We demonstrate that clumped-isotope based temperatures add new quantitative constraints to the relative amounts of biogenic vs. thermogenic gases in the Antrim Shale indicating a larger proportion (∼50\%) of thermogenic gas in the system than previously thought. Additionally, we find that the clumped-isotope temperature of biogenic methane appears related to the environmental settings in which the gas forms. In systems where methane generation rates appear to be slow (e.g., the Antrim Shale and gas seeps), microbial methane forms in or near both internal isotopic equilibrium and hydrogen-isotope equilibrium with environmental waters. In systems where methane forms rapidly, microbial methane is neither in internal isotopic equilibrium nor hydrogen-isotope equilibrium with environmental waters. A quantitative model of microbial methanogenesis that incorporates isotopes is proposed to explain these results.},

A widely cited explanation for this carbon input has been thermal dissociation of gas hydrate on continental slopes, followed by release of {CH}4 from the seafloor and its subsequent oxidation to {CO}2 in the ocean or atmosphere. Increasingly, papers have argued against this mechanism, but without fully considering existing ideas and available data. Moreover, other explanations have been presented as plausible alternatives, even though they conflict with geological observations, they raise major conceptual problems, or both. Methane release from gas hydrates remains a congruous explanation for the δ13C excursion across the {PETM}, although it requires an unconventional framework for global carbon and sulfur cycling, and it lacks proof. These issues are addressed here in the hope that they will prompt appropriate discussions regarding the extraordinary carbon injection at the start of the {PETM} and during other events in Earth's history.},

In nascent, ultraslow-spreading ocean basins, methane generation can also be abiotic, occurring during the high-temperature ({\textgreater}200 °C) serpentinization of ultramafic rocks. Here, we report on the evolution of a growing Arctic gas- and gas hydrate–charged sediment drift on oceanic crust in eastern Fram Strait, a tectonically controlled, deep-water gateway between the subpolar North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Ultraslow-spreading ridges between northwest Svalbard and northeast Greenland permit the sustained interaction of a mid-ocean ridge transform fault and developing sediment drift, on both young ({\textless}10 Ma) and old ({\textgreater}10 Ma) oceanic crust, since the late Miocene. Geophysical data image the gas-charged drift and crustal structure and constrain the timing of a major 30 km lateral displacement of the drift across the Molloy transform fault. We describe the buildup of a 2 m.y., long-lived gas hydrate– and free gas–charged drift system on young oceanic crust that may be fed and maintained by a dominantly abiotic methane source. Ultraslow-spreading, sedimented ridge flanks represent a previously unrecognized carbon reservoir for abiotic methane that could supply and maintain deep-water methane hydrate systems throughout the Arctic.},

To test the hypothesis that this event featured the dispersal of groups from Asia to North America and Europe, we used isotope stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and quantitative biochronology to constrain the relative age of important Asian faunas. The extinct family Hyaenodontidae appeared in Asia before it did so in North America, and the modern orders Primates, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla first appeared in Asia at or before the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. These results are consistent with Asia being a center for early mammalian origination.},

The size of this reservoir is ultimately determined by a balance of organic carbon sources and sinks, which vary in time and space. The loci of large methane deposits are further controlled by thermal, lithological, and structural characteristics of the sediments.

	abstract = {Cascadia margin sediments contain a rich reservoir of carbon derived both from terrestrial input and sea surface productivity. A portion of this carbon exists as solid gas hydrate within sediment pore spaces which previous studies have shown to be a methane reservoir of substantial size on both the Vancouver Island and Oregon portions of the Cascadia margin. Multichannel seismic reflection profiles on the Cascadia margin show the widespread presence of Bottom Simulating Reflectors ({BSRs}) within the sediment column, indicating the gas hydrate reservoir extends from the deformation front at 3000 m depth to the upper limit of gas hydrate stability near 500 m water depth. In this study, we compile an inventory of methane bubble plume sites on the Cascadia margin identified in investigations carried out for a range of interdisciplinary goals that also include sites volunteered by commercial fishermen. High plume density anomalies are associated with both the continental shelf ({\textless}180 m) and the depth of the upper limit of methane hydrate stability depth ({MHSD}) that occurs near 500 m in the {NE} Pacific. The observed anomalies on the Cascadia slope may be due to the warming of seawater at intermediate depths, suggesting that modern climate change has begun to destabilize the climate-sensitive hydrate reservoir within the Cascadia margin sediments. Reanalysis of similar plume images on the North American Atlantic slope suggests a lack of correlation between observed plume depths and the {MHSD} for much of the latitudinal range.},

	abstract = {The East Siberian Arctic Shelf ({ESAS}), which includes the Laptev Sea, the East Siberian Sea, and the Russian part of the Chukchi Sea, has not been considered to be a methane ({CH}4) source to hydrosphere or atmosphere because subsea permafrost, which underlies most of the {ESAS}, was believed, first, not to be conducive to methanogenesis and, second, to act as an impermeable lid, preventing {CH}4 escape through the seabed. Here recent observational data obtained during summer (2005–2006) and winter (2007) expeditions indicate the ubiquitous presence of elevated dissolved {CH}4 and an elevated atmospheric {CH}4 mixing ratio. The {CH}4 data were also analyzed together with high resolution seismic ({HRS}) data obtained by means of a “Sonic M-141” system consisting of a high-resolution profiler and side-scan sonar mounted in a towed fish during the Transdrift-X Expedition (2004) onboard the R/V Yakov Smirnitskiy. Results show anomalously high concentrations of dissolved {CH}4 (up to 5 μM) and an episodically (nongradually) increasing atmospheric mixing ratio of {CH}4 (up to 8.2 ppm) in some areas of the {ESAS}. A most likely source is year-round {CH}4 release through taliks (columns of thawed sediments within permafrost) from seabed {CH}4 reservoirs such as shallow hydrates and geological sources. Such releases occur not only within the areas underlain by fault zones but also outside of them. This points to permafrost's failure to further preserve {CH}4 deposits in the {ESAS}. The total amount of carbon preserved within the {ESAS} as organic matter and ready to release {CH}4 from seabed deposits is predicted to be ∼1400 Gt. Release of only a small fraction of this reservoir, which was sealed with impermeable permafrost for thousands of years, would significantly alter the annual {CH}4 budget and have global implications, because the shallowness of the {ESAS} allows the majority of {CH}4 to pass through the water column and escape to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Over the last 30 years, geochemical research has demonstrated that abiotic methane ({CH}4), formed by chemical reactions which do not directly involve organic matter, occurs on Earth in several specific geologic environments. It can be produced by either high-temperature magmatic processes in volcanic and geothermal areas, or via low-temperature ({\textless}100°C) gas-water-rock reactions in continental settings, even at shallow depths. The isotopic composition of C and H is a first step in distinguishing abiotic from biotic (including either microbial or thermogenic) {CH}4. Herein we demonstrate that integrated geochemical diagnostic techniques, based on molecular composition of associated gases, noble gas isotopes, mixing models, and a detailed knowledge of the geologic and hydrogeologic context are necessary to confirm the occurrence of abiotic {CH}4 in natural gases, which are frequently mixtures of multiple sources. Although it has been traditionally assumed that abiotic {CH}4 is mainly related to mantle-derived or magmatic processes, a new generation of data is showing that low-temperature synthesis related to gas-water-rock reactions is more common than previously thought. This paper reviews the major sources of abiotic {CH}4 and the primary approaches for differentiating abiotic from biotic {CH}4, including novel potential tools such as clumped isotope geochemistry. A diagnostic approach for differentiation is proposed.},

Most of the hydrate in the model is in the Pacific, in large part because lower oxygen levels enhance the preservation of organic carbon. Because the oxygen concentration today may be different from the long-term average, the sensitivity of the model to O2 is a source of uncertainty in predicting hydrate inventories. Cold water column temperatures in the high latitudes lead to buildup of hydrates in the Arctic and Antarctic at shallower depths than is possible in low latitudes. A critical bubble volume fraction threshold has been proposed as a critical threshold at which gas migrates all through the sediment column. Our model lacks many factors that lead to heterogeneity in the real hydrate reservoir in the ocean, such as preferential hydrate formation in sandy sediments and subsurface gas migration, and is therefore conservative in its prediction of releasable methane, finding only 35 Pg of C released after 3 °C of uniform warming by using a 10\% critical bubble volume. If 2.5\% bubble volume is taken as critical, then 940 Pg of C might escape in response to 3 °C warming. This hydrate model embedded into a global climate model predicts ≈0.4–0.5 °C additional warming from the hydrate response to fossil fuel {CO}2 release, initially because of methane, but persisting through the 10-kyr duration of the simulations because of the {CO}2 oxidation product of methane.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that archaea which were always thought to live under strict anoxic or extreme environmental conditions are also present in cold, oxygenated seawater, soils, the digestive tract of a holothurian deep-sea-deposit feeder, and a marine sponge. In this study, we show, by using {PCR}-mediated screening in other marine eukaryotes, that marine archaea are also present in the digestive tracts of flounder and grey mullet, two fish species common in the North Sea, in fecal samples of flounder, and in suspended particulate matter of the North Sea water column. No marine archaea could be detected in the digestive tracts of mussels or the fecal pellets of a copepod species. The archaeal 16S ribosomal {DNA} clone libraries of feces of flounder and the contents of the digestive tracts of grey mullet and flounder were dominated by group {II} marine archaea. The marine archaeal clones derived from flounder and grey mullet digestive tracts and feces formed a distinct cluster within the group {II} marine archaea, with 76.7 to 89.8\% similarity to previously described group {II} clones. Fingerprinting of the archaeal community of flounder digestive tract contents and feces by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of archaeal 16S {rRNA} genes after restriction {withHhaI} showed a dominant fragment at 249 bp, which is likely to be derived from group {II} marine archaea. Clones of marine archaea that were closely related to the fish-associated marine archaea clones were obtained from suspended particulate matter of the water column at two stations in the North Sea. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the archaeal community present in suspended particulate matter showed the same fragment pattern as was found for the archaeal community of the flounder digestive tract contents and feces. These data demonstrate that marine archaea are present in the digestive tracts and feces of very common marine fish. It is possible that the marine archaea associated with the digestive tracts of marine fish are liberated into the water column through the feces and subsequently contribute to the marine archaeal community of suspended particulate matter.},

The Bering Sea is a highly productive system dominated by seasonal blooms and was used as a model system for algal proteins to be tracked through the water column and incorporated into detrital sedimentary material. Samples of suspended and sinking particles were collected at multiple depths along with surface sediments on the continental shelf and deeper basin of the Bering Sea. Modified standard proteomic preparations were used in conjunction with high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify the suite of proteins present and monitor changes in their distribution. In surface waters 207 proteins were identified, decreasing through the water column to 52 proteins identified in post-bloom shelf surface sediments and 24 proteins in deeper (3490 m) basin sediments. The vast majority of identified proteins in all samples were diatom in origin, reflecting their dominant contribution of biomass during the spring bloom. Identified proteins were predominantly from metabolic, binding/structural, and transport-related protein groups. Significant linear correlations were observed between the number of proteins identified and the concentration of total hydrolysable amino acids normalized to carbon and nitrogen. Organelle-bound, transmembrane, photosynthetic, and other proteins involved in light harvesting were preferentially retained during recycling. These findings suggest that organelle and membrane protection represent important mechanisms that enhance the preservation of protein during transport and incorporation into sediments.},

	abstract = {Research in the area of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotic therapies has gained much attention since the recent emergence of vancomycin resistant bacteria. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic which functions by binding directly to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of peptidoglycan precursors thereby inhibiting cross-linking by the transpeptidase enzyme. We have developed an analytical approach which utilizes sensitive and selective electrospray {LC}/{MS} techniques to determine the molecular weight of cytoplasmic precursors present in samples harvested from vancomycin resistant cells. Substructure analysis strategies utilizing {LC}/{MS}/{MS} protocols provide on-line structure identification by comparison of the mass spectrometric characteristics of unknown precursors with the substructural "template" of the standard pentapeptide precursor. Differences between resulting product ion spectra are indicative of altered and/or modified substructures. Using a novel application of affinity capillary electrophoresis ({ACE}) techniques, we have also obtained binding information for these precursors. Rapid screening of a variety of peptidoglycan molecules has been performed and resulting binding constants were obtained from Scatchard plots. The affinity of peptidoglycan precursors to vancomycin can be related to structure and provide a basis for proposing possible mechanisms of action. The results of these findings are significant with respect to revealing the mechanism(s) of bacteria resistance as structural evidence was obtained which confirmed the presence of a peptidoglycan precursor terminating in lactate rather than alanine. This structural information serves as a valuable platform for understanding mechanisms of resistance, and hopefully, the design of novel and unique therapies for intervention.},

Lysis of P. pouchetii by {PpV} had strong positive effects on bacterial and {HNF} abundance, and the mass balance of C, N and P suggested an efficient transfer of organic material from P. pouchetii to bacterial and {HNF} biomass through viral lysis. At the same time, the degradation of P. pouchetii lysates was associated with significant regeneration of inorganic N and P resulting in 148 microg N l(-1) and 7 microg P l(-1), corresponding to 78\% and 26\% of lysate N and P being mineralized to {NH}(4)(+) and {PO}(4)(3-), respectively. These results showed that the turnover of viral lysates in the microbial food web was associated with significant N and P mineralization, supporting the current view that viral lysates can be an important source of inorganic nutrients in marine systems. In the presence of R. salina, the generated {NH}(4)(+) supported 11\% of the observed R. salina growth. Regrowth of virus-resistant P. pouchetii following cell lysis was observed in long-term incubations (150 days), and possibly influenced by nutrient availability and competition from R. salina. The observed impact of viral activity on autotrophic and heterotrophic processes provides direct experimental evidence for virus-driven nutrient generation and emphasizes the potential importance of the viral activity in supporting marine primary production.},

	abstract = {Marine sponges are vital components of benthic and coral reef ecosystems, providing shelter and nutrition for many organisms. In addition, sponges act as an essential carbon and nutrient link between the pelagic and benthic environment by filtering large quantities of seawater. Many sponge species harbor a diverse microbial community (including Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryotes), which can constitute up to 50\% of the sponge biomass. Sponges of the genus Cinachyrella are common in Caribbean and Floridian reefs and their archaeal and bacterial microbiomes were explored here using 16S {rRNA} gene tag pyrosequencing. Cinachyrella specimens and seawater samples were collected from the same South Florida reef at two different times of year. In total, 639 {OTUs} (12 archaeal and 627 bacterial) belonging to 2 archaeal and 21 bacterial phyla were detected in the sponges. Based on their microbiomes, the six sponge samples formed two distinct groups, namely sponge group 1 ({SG}1) with lower diversity (Shannon-Weiner index: 3.73 ± 0.22) and {SG}2 with higher diversity (Shannon-Weiner index: 5.95 ± 0.25). Hosts' 28S {rRNA} gene sequences further confirmed that the sponge specimens were composed of two taxa closely related to Cinachyrella kuekenthalli. Both sponge groups were dominated by Proteobacteria, but Alphaproteobacteria were significantly more abundant in {SG}1. {SG}2 harbored many bacterial phyla ({\textgreater}1\% of sequences) present in low abundance or below detection limits ({\textless}0.07\%) in {SG}1 including: Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, {PAUC}34f, Poribacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Furthermore, {SG}1 and {SG}2 only had 95 {OTUs} in common, representing 30.5 and 22.4\% of {SG}1 and {SG}2's total {OTUs}, respectively. These results suggest that the sponge host may exert a pivotal influence on the nature and structure of the microbial community and may only be marginally affected by external environment parameters.},

However, the key carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (S) cycling processes catalyzed by {OMZ} microbial communities are poorly constrained spatially, temporally, and with regard to the different microbial groups involved. Here we sample across dissolved oxygen ({DO}) gradients in the oceans' largest {OMZ} by volume-the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, or {ETNP}-and quantify 16S {rRNA} and functional gene transcripts to detect and constrain the activity of different S-cycling groups. Based on gene expression profiles, putative dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({dsrA}) genes are actively expressed within the {ETNP} {OMZ}. {dsrA} expression was limited almost entirely to samples with elevated nitrite concentrations, consistent with previous observations in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific {OMZ}. {dsrA} and 'reverse' dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({rdsrA}) genes are related and the associated enzymes are known to operate in either direction-reducing or oxidizing different S compounds. We found that {rdsrA} genes and {soxB} genes were expressed in the same samples, suggestive of active S cycling in the {ETNP} {OMZ}. These data provide potential thresholds for S cycling in {OMZs} that closely mimic recent predictions, and indicate that S cycling may be broadly relevant in {OMZs}.},

Bottom water oxygen was below detection limit down to ca. 400 m and increased to 53 μM at the deepest station. Sediment accumulation rates decreased sharply seaward of the middle shelf and subsequently increased at the deep stations. The organic carbon burial efficiency ({CBE}) was unusually low on the middle shelf ({\textless}20\%) when compared to an existing global database, for reasons which may be linked to episodic ventilation of the bottom waters by oceanographic anomalies. Deposition of reworked, degraded material originating from sites higher up on the slope is proposed to explain unusually high sedimentation rates and {CBE} ({\textgreater}60\%) at the deep oxygenated sites. In line with other studies, {CBE} was elevated under oxygen-deficient waters in the mid-water oxygen minimum zone. Organic carbon rain rates calculated from the benthic fluxes alluded to efficient mineralisation of organic matter in the water column compared to other oxygen-deficient environments. The observations at the Peruvian margin suggest that a lack of oxygen does not greatly affect the degradation of organic matter in the water column but promotes the preservation of organic matter in sediments.},

The decay of tripalmitate added to cultures was followed chemically over time. In an enzymatic approach, lipase activities were measured using the fluorogenic lipid analogs {MUF}-palmitate and {ELF}-palmitate. When hydrolyzed by lipase, the non-fluorescent substrates release {MUF} and {ELF} Alcohol ({ELFA}) which are fluorescent. As shown by spectrofluorometry, {ELF}-palmitate was an efficient competitor for {MUF}-palmitate. However, the activities reached using these two fluorogenic substrates were different, but still much higher than the tripalmitate hydrolysis rate, measured chemically. {MUF}- and {ELF}-palmitate would not be hydrolyzed by lipase sensu stricto (defined as triacylglycerol acylesterase E.C. 3.1.1.3) but rather reflects lipolytic activities in a broad sense. {ELFA} is also water-insoluble and theoretically precipitates in the external membrane of bacteria causing its hydrolysis, which would allow microscopic identification of active cells. By epifluorescence microscopy, the accumulation of {ELFA} fluorescence over time was detected (as large, diffuse halos), but no precipitates were clearly associated with bacteria on slide preparations, neither for pure cultures of Alteromonas macleodii nor for natural samples from the Bay of Marseille, France. Among possible biases, those related to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic conditions required for precipitation are discussed.},

We explored if the observed patterns of organic matter accumulation could be explained by differences in productivity, sedimentation rate, water depth, and mineral texture. The differences in the burial rates of organic matter in sediments deposited within or below the {OMZ} could not be explained on the basis of these factors. All collected evidence points to a coupling of low oxygen concentrations and enhanced organic matter preservation. Under more oxygenated conditions bioturbation as well as the presence of labile manganese and iron oxides are probably important factors for a more efficient microbially mediated degradation of organic matter. Pore water profiles of dissolved Mn2+ and Fe2+ show that reduction of manganese and iron oxides plays a minor role in sediments lying within the {OMZ} and a larger role in sediments lying below the {OMZ}.},

It is unclear how the taxonomic composition and metabolism of {OMZ} microorganisms vary between particle-associated and free-living size fractions. We used amplicon (16S {rRNA} gene) and shotgun metagenome sequencing to compare microbial communities from large ({\textgreater}1.6 μm) and small (0.2-1.6 μm) filter size fractions along a depth gradient in the {OMZ} off Chile. Despite steep vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger predictor of community composition compared to depth. Phylogenetic diversity showed contrasting patterns, decreasing towards the anoxic {OMZ} core in the small size fraction, but exhibiting maximal values at these depths within the larger size fraction. Fraction-specific distributions were evident for key {OMZ} taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0.2-1.6 μm community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions, with the {\textgreater}1.6 μm community significantly enriched in genes mediating social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity. Prokaryotic transposase genes were three to six fold more abundant in this fraction, comprising up to 2\% of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that particle surfaces may act as hotbeds for transposition-based genome changes in marine microbes. Genes for nitric and nitrous oxide reduction were also more abundant (three to seven fold) in the larger size fraction, suggesting microniche partitioning of key denitrification steps. These results highlight an important role for surface attachment in shaping community metabolic potential and genome content in {OMZ} microorganisms.},

	abstract = {The present upper water mass of the northeastern Pacific Ocean off California has a well-developed oxygen minimum zone between 600 and 1200 m wherein concentrations of dissolved oxygen are less than 0.5 {mL}/L. Even at such low concentrations of dissolved oxygen, benthic burrowing organisms are abundant enough to thoroughly bioturbate the surface and near-surface sediments. These macro organisms, together with micro organisms, also consume large quantities of organic carbon produced by large seasonal stocks of plankton in the overlying surface waters, which are supported by high concentrations of nutrients within the California Current upwelling system. In contrast to modern conditions of bioturbation, laminated sediments are preserved in upper Pleistocene sections of cores collected on the continental slope at water depths within the present oxygen minimum zone from at least as far north as the California-Oregon border and as far south as Point Conception. Comparison of sediment components in the laminae with those delivered to sediment traps as pelagic marine “snow” demonstrates that the dark-light lamination couplets are indeed annual (varves). These upper Pleistocene varved sediments contain more abundant lipid-rich “sapropelic” (type {II}) organic matter than the overlying bioturbated, oxidized Holocene sediments. The baseline of stable carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter in these slope cores does not change with time, indicating that the higher concentrations of type {II} organic matter in the varved sediments represent better preservation of organic matter rather than any change in the source of organic matter.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones are expanding globally, and at present account for around 20–40\% of oceanic nitrogen loss. Heterotrophic denitrification and anammox—anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite—are responsible for most nitrogen loss in these low-oxygen waters. Anammox is particularly significant in the eastern tropical South Pacific, one of the largest oxygen minimum zones globally. However, the factors that regulate anammox-driven nitrogen loss have remained unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive nitrogen budget for the eastern tropical South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, using measurements of nutrient concentrations, experimentally determined rates of nitrogen transformation and a numerical model of export production. Anammox was the dominant mode of nitrogen loss at the time of sampling. Rates of anammox, and related nitrogen transformations, were greatest in the productive shelf waters, and tailed off with distance from the coast. Within the shelf region, anammox activity peaked in both upper and bottom waters. Overall, rates of nitrogen transformation, including anammox, were strongly correlated with the export of organic matter. We suggest that the sinking of organic matter, and thus the release of ammonium into the water column, together with benthic ammonium release, fuel nitrogen loss from oxygen minimum zones.

Sediment samples were analysed for total nitrogen ({TN}) and organic carbon ({OC}) contents, mineral surface area ({SA}), and total hydrolysable amino acids ({THAA}) and enzymatically hydrolysable amino acids ({EHAA}). {OC} contents and organic carbon per unit of mineral surface area ({OC}/{SA}) values were clearly elevated in the core and lower {OMZ} transition zone. These sediments also contained more labile sedimentary organic matter, as discerned by higher concentrations of {THAA} and the contribution of N in {THAA} to {TN}. A protein amino acid-based degradation index revealed that all sedimentary organic matter has undergone significant degradation, but sediments in the upper {OMZ} transition zone and below the {OMZ} are more degraded than inside the {OMZ}. Changes in amino acid composition during diagenesis are attributed to a combination of factors: (1) selective preservation in which amino acids in cell walls are better preserved than amino acids in cell plasma, (2) formation and accumulation of bacterially derived organic matter; there were relatively more living bacteria in the core of the {OMZ} and an accumulation of peptidoglycan-derived amino acids in degraded sediments in the upper {OMZ} transition zone and below the {OMZ}, and (3) bacterial transformation, as the molar percentages of bacterial transformation products β-alanine (Bala), γ-amino butyric acid (Gaba), and ornithine (Orn), increased with increasing degradation.},

	abstract = {Green sulfur bacteria are obligate photolithoautotrophs that require highly reducing conditions for growth and can utilize only a very limited number of carbon substrates. These bacteria thus inhabit a very narrow ecologic niche. However, several green sulfur bacteria have overcome the limits of immobility by entering into a symbiosis with motile Betaproteobacteria in a type of multicellular association termed phototrophic consortia. One of these consortia, “Chlorochromatium aggregatum,” has recently been established as the first culturable model system to elucidate the molecular basis of this symbiotic interaction. It consists of 12–20 green sulfur bacteria epibionts surrounding a central, chemoheterotrophic betaproteobacterium in a highly ordered fashion. Recent genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of “C. aggregatum” and its epibiont provide insights into the molecular basis and the origin of the stable association between the two very distantly related bacteria. While numerous genes of central metabolic pathways are upregulated during the specific symbiosis and hence involved in the interaction, only a limited number of unique putative symbiosis genes have been detected in the epibiont. Green sulfur bacteria therefore are preadapted to a symbiotic lifestyle. The metabolic coupling between the bacterial partners appears to involve amino acids and highly specific ultrastructures at the contact sites between the cells. Similarly, the interaction in the equally well studied archaeal consortia consisting of Nanoarchaeum equitans and its host Ignicoccus hospitalis is based on the transfer of amino acids while lacking the highly specialized contact sites observed in phototrophic consortia.},

According to the law of chemical equilibrium, the consumption of excreted metabolites by recipient microbes can accelerate the metabolism of donor microbes. This is the concept of syntrophy, which is a type of mutualism and governs the metabolism and growth of diverse microbes in natural and engineered ecosystems. A representative example of syntrophy is found in methanogenic communities, where reducing equivalents, e.g., hydrogen and formate, transfer between syntrophic partners. Studies have revealed that microbes involved in syntrophy have evolved molecular mechanisms to establish specific partnerships and interspecies communication, resulting in efficient metabolic cooperation. In addition, recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that microbial interspecies transfer of reducing equivalents also occurs as electric current via biotic (e.g., pili) and abiotic (e.g., conductive mineral and carbon particles) electric conduits. In this review, we describe these findings as examples of sophisticated cooperative behavior between different microbial species. We suggest that these interactions have fundamental roles in shaping the structure and activity of microbial communities.},

In this study, we systematically survey, by using a metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding in over 800 microbial communities from diverse habitats. We show that interspecies metabolic exchanges are widespread in natural communities, and that such exchanges can provide group advantage under nutrient-poor conditions. Our results highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence. The presented methodology and mechanistic insights have broad implications for understanding compositional variation in natural communities as well as for facilitating the design of synthetic microbial communities., Microbial communities populate most environments on earth and play a critical role in ecology and human health. Their composition is thought to be largely shaped by interspecies competition for the available resources, but cooperative interactions, such as metabolite exchanges, have also been implicated in community assembly. The prevalence of metabolic interactions in microbial communities, however, has remained largely unknown. Here, we systematically survey, by using a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic exchanges in over 800 communities. We find that, despite marked resource competition at the level of whole assemblies, microbial communities harbor metabolically interdependent groups that recur across diverse habitats. By enumerating flux-balanced metabolic exchanges in these co-occurring subcommunities we also predict the likely exchanged metabolites, such as amino acids and sugars, that can promote group survival under nutritionally challenging conditions. Our results highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence and hint at cooperative groups as recurring modules of microbial community architecture.},

Compared to conventional proteomics, metaproteomics presents unique data analysis challenges, including the use of large protein databases derived from hundreds or thousands of organisms, as well as numerous processing steps to ensure high data quality. These challenges limit the use of metaproteomics for many researchers. In response, we have developed an accessible and flexible metaproteomics workflow within the Galaxy bioinformatics framework. Via analysis of human oral tissue exudate samples, we have established a modular Galaxy-based workflow that automates a reduction method for searching large sequence databases, enabling comprehensive identification of host proteins (human) as well as "meta-proteins" from the nonhost organisms. Downstream, automated processing steps enable basic local alignment search tool analysis and evaluation/visualization of peptide sequence match quality, maximizing confidence in results. Outputted results are compatible with tools for taxonomic and functional characterization (e.g. Unipept, {MEGAN}5). Galaxy also allows for the sharing of complete workflows with others, promoting reproducibility and also providing a template for further modification and enhancement.

In order to assess the importance of these individual factors, we studied the effect of strategies to combine different search algorithms, explored the influence of chosen database search settings, and investigated the impact of the size of the protein sequence database used for identification. Furthermore, we applied de novo sequencing as a complementary approach to classic database searching. All evaluations were performed on a human intestinal metaproteome dataset. Pyrococcus furiosus proteome data were used to contrast database searching of metaproteomic data to a classic proteomic experiment. Searching against subsets of metaproteome databases and the use of multiple search engines increased the number of identifications. The integration of P. furiosus sequences in a metaproteomic sequence database showcased the limitation of the target-decoy-controlled false discovery rate approach in combination with large sequence databases. The selection of varying search engine parameters and the application of de novo sequencing represented useful methods to increase the reliability of the results.

Comparisons of δ13C values of whole cells, cell wall peptidoglycan and the amino acids d-alanine and diaminopimelic acid from the cell wall were made using different carbon substrates and through different stages of growth to determine isotopic fractionation of these compounds. The δ13C values of whole cells, peptidoglycan and d-alanine and the substrate sources (glucose, glutamic acid, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine) were similar. The δ13C values of the d-alanine were within 0.5‰ of the substrate. In comparison, diaminopimelic acid was enriched in 13C by 10.3‰ relative to the whole cells, peptidoglycan and substrate. Additional laboratory experiments also demonstrated that the δ13C of d-alanine did not vary significantly relative to the whole cell and substrate through different growth stages. Stable carbon isotope analysis of the bacterial amino acids was determined at two field locations, water from Santa Rosa Sound, Florida, a humic rich estuarine ecosystem, and jet-fuel contaminated soils of Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. d-alanine and diaminopimelic acid were isolated from these water and soil samples and the amino acids were analyzed for purity after extraction and for their δ13C values relative to organic matter in the environments. In the Santa Rosa Sound the δ13C value of d-alanine was −27.6±0.6‰. This value is in the range of δ13C values of bacteria and organic matter previously measured in the system, −24.0 to −27.0‰. The δ13C value of d-alanine in soil samples from Tyndall Air Force Base was −20.5±1.7‰ (n= 4) similar to ranges of values measured for spilled jet-fuel and {CO}2 respired from the soil at this site. Results from this study demonstrate that d-alanine can be used as a biomarker for analysis of carbon sources that are assimilated by bacteria in soils and sediments.},

Free-living cells live in a dilute and complex substrate field, and to gain enough substrate, their extracellular enzymes must be utilized efficiently. The model revealed that surface-attached and free enzymes generate unique enzyme and substrate fields, and each deployment strategy has distinctive advantages. For a solitary cell, surface-attached enzymes are suggested to be the most cost-efficient strategy. This strategy entails potential substrates being reduced to very low concentrations. Free enzymes, on the other hand, generate a radically different substrate field, which suggests significant benefits for the strategy if free cells engage in social foraging or experience high substrate concentrations. Swimming has a slight positive effect for the attached-enzyme strategy, while the effect is negative for the free-enzyme strategy. The results of this study suggest that specific dissolved organic compounds in the ocean likely persist below a threshold concentration impervious to biological utilization. This could help explain the persistence and apparent refractory state of oceanic dissolved organic matter ({DOM}). Microbial extracellular enzyme strategies, therefore, have important implications for larger-scale processes, such as shaping the role of {DOM} in ocean carbon sequestration.},

In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring ∼6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

Protists are single-celled organisms complete with nuclei, organelles, and symbionts, and possess a multiplicity of physiological talents. They are ubiquitous, abundant, and often neglected by science. Worden et al. review the challenges of understanding the role protists play in geochemical cycling in the oceans. These organisms can photosynthesize like plants, graze on bacteria and archaea, parasitize each other and bigger creatures, have sex, and sometimes do all these things serially as conditions change. Their activities may have a significant influence on carbon cycling, and research efforts need to be amplified to understand their functional importance in marine ecosystems.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1257594
Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUND} Marine ecosystems are composed of a diverse array of life forms, the majority of which are unicellular—archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. The power of these microbes to process carbon, shape Earth’s atmosphere, and fuel marine food webs has been established over the past 40 years. The marine biosphere is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, rivaling that of land plants. Unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are major contributors to this ocean productivity. In addition to photosynthetic growth, protists exhibit a range of other trophic modes, including predation, mixotrophy (a combination of photosynthetic and predatory-based nutrition), parasitism, symbiosis, osmotrophy, and saprotrophy (wherein extracellular enzymes break down organic matter to smaller compounds that are then transported into the cell by osmotrophy).
{ADVANCES} Sensitive field approaches have illuminated the enormous diversity of protistan life (much of it uncultured) and, coupled with activity measurements, are leading to hypotheses about their ecological roles. In parallel, large-scale sequencing projects are providing fundamental advances in knowledge of genome/gene composition, especially among photosynthetic lineages, many of which are complex amalgams derived from multiple endosymbiotic mergers. Marine protists have yielded insight into basic biology, evolution, and molecular machineries that control organismal responses to the environment. These studies reveal tightly controlled signaling and transcriptional regulation as well as responses to limitation of resources such as iron, nitrogen, and vitamins, and offer understanding of animal and plant evolution. With the formulation of better computational approaches, hypotheses about interactions and trophic exchanges are becoming more exact and modelers more assertive at integrating different data types. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are being reported in multiple systems, of which polar environments are the touchstone of change.
{OUTLOOK} Driven by the need to translate the biology of cells into processes at global scales, researchers must bring the conceptual framework of systems biology into bigger “ecosystems biology” models that broadly capture the geochemical activities of interacting plankton networks. Existing data show that protists are major components of marine food webs, but deducing and quantifying their ecosystem linkages and the resulting influences on carbon cycling is difficult. Genome-based functional predictions are complicated by the importance of cellular structures and flexible behaviors in protists, which are inherently more difficult to infer than the biochemical pathways typically studied in prokaryotes. Alongside the plethora of genes of unknown function, manipulable genetic systems are rare for marine protists. The development of genetic systems and gene editing for diverse, ecologically important lineages, as well as innovative tools for preserving microbe-microbe interactions during sampling, for visual observation, and for quantifying biogeochemical transformations, are critical but attainable goals. These must be implemented in both field work and laboratory physiology studies that examine multiple environmental factors. Expanding genome functional predictions to identify the molecular underpinnings of protistan trophic modes and realistically constrain metabolism will position the field to build reliable cell systems biology models and link these to field studies. By factoring in true complexities, we can capture key elements of protistan interactions for assimilation into more predictive global carbon cycle models. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6223/1257594/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Global biogeochemical and ecological models rely on understanding organismal biology and the interactions occurring in marine microbial food webs. Protists have multifarious roles from the sunlit surface ocean to leagues below. Understanding of protistan behaviors and adaptability lags far behind knowledge of evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomes. As such, microbial mediation of carbon fluxes and specific interactions remain ill-resolved and predictive capabilities are still weak. Strategies to narrow this gap involve iteration between experimental and observational field studies, controlled laboratory experiments, systems biology approaches that preserve cellular structures and behaviors using relevant model taxa, and computational approaches.
The profound influence of marine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires—a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences. We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.},

	abstract = {Background
Macaca mulatta is one of the most utilized non-human primate species in biomedical research offering unique behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurobiochemcial similarities to humans. This makes it a unique organism to model various diseases such as psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses while also providing insight into the complexities of the primate brain. A major obstacle in utilizing rhesus monkey models for human disease is the paucity of protein annotations for this species ({\textasciitilde}42,000 protein annotations) compared to 330,210 protein annotations for humans. The lack of available information limits the use of rhesus monkey for proteomic scale studies which rely heavily on database searches for protein identification. While characterization of proteins of interest from Macaca mulatta using the standard database search engines (e.g., {MASCOT}) can be accomplished, searches must be performed using a 'broad species database' which does not provide optimal confidence in protein annotation. Therefore, it becomes necessary to determine partial or complete amino acid sequences using either manual or automated de novo peptide sequence analysis methods.

Results
The recently popularized {MALDI}-{TOF}-{TOF} mass spectrometer yields a complex {MS}/{MS} fragmentation pattern difficult to characterize by manual de novo sequencing method on a proteomics scale. Therefore, {PEAKS} assisted de novo sequencing was performed on nucleus accumbens cytosolic proteins from Macaca mulatta. The most abundant peptide fragments 'b-ions and y-ions', the less abundant peptide fragments 'a-ions' as well as the immonium ions were utilized to develop confident and complete peptide sequences de novo from {MS}/{MS} spectra. The generated sequences were used to perform homology searches to characterize the protein identification.

Conclusion
The current study validates a robust method to confidently characterize the proteins from an incomplete sequence database of Macaca mulatta, using the {PEAKS} de novo sequencing software, facilitating the use of this animal model in various neuroproteomics studies.},

Although the basic chemical composition of peptidoglycan, the key constituent of the cell wall, is now well established, its long-range organization is not. This dearth of information at the mesoscopic scale is a result of the inability of experimental imaging techniques to simultaneously visualize both the atomic-level detail of the peptidoglycan network and its macroscopic arrangement around the bacterium. Now, using molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations, we have carefully constructed and validated models of sections of the  Escherichia coli  cell wall in full atomic detail. By comparing various properties of these models, including elasticity, pore size, and thickness with experiments, we can discriminate between them, resolving which best represents the native wall structure. In doing so, our study provides approaches for connecting measurements made in atomic-scale {MD} simulations with large-scale and even macroscopic properties.},

Currently, there are many specialized methods that can be used to extract pure biomolecules, such as solution-based and column-based protocols. Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods.

In order to study the significance of chitin decomposition in two temperate freshwater lakes with contrasting trophic and redox conditions, we measured the turnover rate of the chitin analog methylumbelliferyl-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside ({MUF}-{DC}) and the presence of chitinase ({chiA}) genes in zooplankton, water, and sediment samples. In contrast to the eutrophic and partially anoxic lake, {chiA} gene fragments were detectable throughout the oligotrophic water column and {chiA} copy numbers per ml of water were up to 15 times higher than in the eutrophic waters. For both lakes, the highest {chiA} abundance was found in the euphotic zone—the main habitat of zooplankton, but also the site of production of easily degradable algal chitin. The bulk of chitinase activity was measured in zooplankton samples and the sediments, where recalcitrant chitin is deposited. Both, {chiA} abundance and chitinase activity correlated well with organic carbon, nitrogen, and concentrations of particulate {GlcN}. Our findings show that chitin, although its overall contribution to the total organic carbon is small (∼0.01 to 0.1\%), constitutes an important microbial growth substrate in these temperate freshwater lakes, particularly where other easily degradable carbon sources are scarce.},

	abstract = {Motivation: One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.
Results: We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the {ROC} curve from 76\% to 87\%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.

	abstract = {This article describes single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements of the interaction between individual amino acid residues and inorganic surfaces in an aqueous solution. In each measurement, there is an amino acid residue, lysine, glutamate, phenylalanine, leucine, or glutamine, and each represents a class of amino acids (positively or negatively charged, aromatic, nonpolar, and polar). Force–distance curves measured the interaction of the individual amino acid bound to a silicon atomic force microscope ({AFM}) tip with a silcon substrate, cut from a single-crystal wafer, or mica. Using this method, we were able to measure low adhesion forces (below 300 {pN}) and could clearly determine the strength of interactions between the individual amino acid residues and the inorganic substrate. In addition, we observed how changes in the {pH} and ionic strength of the solution affected the adsorption of the residues to the substrates. Our results pinpoint the important role of hydrophobic interactions among the amino acids and the substrate, where hydrophobic phenylalanine exhibited the strongest adhesion to a silicon substrate. Additionally, electrostatic interactions also contributed to the adsorption of amino acid residues to inorganic substrates. A change in the {pH} or ionic strength values of the buffer altered the strength of interactions among the amino acids and the substrate. We concluded that the interplay between the hydrophobic forces and electrostatic interactions will determine the strength of adsorption among the amino acids and the surface. Overall, these results contribute to our understanding of the interaction at the organic–inorganic interface. These results may have implications for our perception of the specificity of peptide binding to inorganic surfaces. Consequently, it would possibly lead to a better design of composite materials and devices.},

	abstract = {Sorption of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) is considered to be a major process in the preservation of organic matter ({OM}) in marine sediments. Evidence for this hypothesis includes the close relationship between sediment surface area ({SA}) and organic carbon ({OC}) concentrations and the strongly reduced biological degradability after {DOM} has sorbed to mineral surfaces. The aim of this study was to discuss the possibility of a similar process in the soil environment. We accomplished this by gathering information from the literature, and by an evaluation of our own studies on {DOM} sorption and accumulation of {OM} in soil. We found that in soil a close association of {OM} with the mineral matrix exists. Both the concentration of soil {OM} associated with the mineral matrix, and the sorption of {DOM} are related to reactive mineral phases such as Al and Fe oxyhydroxides. Sorption of {DOM} derived from the oxidative decomposition of lignocellulose to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides involves strong complexation bondings between surface metals and acidic organic ligands, particularly with those associated with aromatic structures. The strength of the sorption relates to the surface area but more importantly to the surface properties of the sorbing mineral phase. The sorption of a large part of {DOM} is hardly reversible under conditions similar to those during sorption (hysteresis). Because sorption of the more labile polysaccharide-derived {DOM} on mineral surfaces is weaker, adsorptive and desorptive processes strongly favour the accumulation of the more recalcitrant lignin-derived {DOM}. In addition, we found the soil {OM} in an alluvial B horizon and in the clay fraction of a topsoil strongly resembling lignin-derived {DOM} from the overlying forest floors. Hence, it seems likely that sorption of {DOM} contributes considerably to the accumulation and preservation of {OM} in soil. However, this does not result in a significant relationship between {OC} concentration and {SA}. Reasons for that finding may be the ”masking” of mineral surfaces by adsorbed {OM}, the clustering of {OM} patches at highly reactive sites of metal hydroxides, and/or the absence of a relationship between {SA} and the concentration of surface-active Fe and Al oxyhydroxides in some soil types. Overall, we conclude that sorptive preservation of {OM} in soil is affected by the chemical structure of the sorbing {DOM} and the surface properties of the mineral matrix. Localisation and conformation of sorbed {OM} remains unclear and therefore should be subject of further research.},

Growing bacteria release muropeptide fragments of the cell wall into the extracellular milieu, and we report here that these muropeptides are potent germinants of dormant Bacillus subtilis spores. The ability of a muropeptide to act as a germinant is determined by the identity of a single amino acid. A well-conserved, eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr membrane kinase containing an extracellular domain capable of binding peptidoglycan is necessary for this response, and a small molecule that stimulates related eukaryotic kinases is sufficient to induce germination. Another small molecule, staurosporine, that inhibits related eukaryotic kinases blocks muropeptide-dependent germination. Thus, in contrast to traditional antimicrobials that inhibit metabolically active cells, staurosporine acts by blocking germination of dormant spores.},

Vancomycin and other new glycopeptide derivatives target the bacterial cell wall, thereby perturbing its biosynthesis. To help determine the modes of action of glycopeptide antibiotics, we have developed a bottom-up mass spectrometry approach complemented by solid-state {NMR} to elucidate important structural characteristics of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium peptidoglycan. Using accurate-mass measurements and integrating ion-current chromatographic peaks of digested peptidoglycan, we identified individual muropeptide species and approximated the relative amount of each. Even though the organism investigated is susceptible to vancomycin, only 3\% of the digested peptidoglycan has the well-known D-Ala-D-Ala vancomycin-binding site. The data are consistent with a previously proposed template model of cell-wall biosynthesis where D-Ala-D-Ala stems that are not cross-linked are cleaved in mature peptidoglycan. Additionally, our mass-spectrometry approach allowed differentiation and quantification of muropeptide species seen as unresolved chromatographic peaks. Our method provides an estimate of the extent of muropeptides containing O-acetylation, amidation and hydroxylation, and the number of species forming cyclic imides. The varieties of muropeptides on which the modifications are detected suggest that significant processing occurs in mature peptidoglycan where several enzymes are active in editing cell-wall structure.},

The most common approaches rely on the available databases to match experimental {MS}/{MS} data. These methods suffer from several drawbacks and cannot be used for the identification of proteins from unknown genomes. In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, {PEAKS}, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. {PEAKS} uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the {MS}/{MS} spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of {PEAKS} is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-{TOF}) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.},

How these microorganisms do this work at the level of the expressed protein is known only from a few studies of targeted lineages. We used comparative membrane metaproteomics to identify functional responses of communities to different nutrient concentrations on an oceanic scale. Comparative analyses of microbial membrane fractions revealed shifts in nutrient utilization and energy transduction along an environmental gradient in South Atlantic surface waters, from a low-nutrient gyre to a highly productive coastal upwelling region. The dominant membrane proteins identified (19\%) were {TonB}-dependent transporters ({TBDTs}), which are known to utilize a proton motive force to transport nutrients across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The ocean-wide importance of {TonB}-dependent nutrient acquisition in marine bacteria was unsuspected. Diverse light-harvesting rhodopsins were detected in membrane proteomes from every sample. Proteomic evidence of both {TBDTs} and rhodopsins in the same lineages suggest that phototrophic bacterioplankton have the potential to use energy from light to fuel transport activities. We also identified viral proteins in every sample and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase proteins in the upwelling region, suggesting that Archaea are important nitrifiers in nutrient-rich surface waters.},

To understand the interactions between {DOM} and the bacterial community ({BC}), it is important to identify the key factors on both sides in detail, chemically distinct moieties in {DOM} and the various bacterial taxa. Next-generation sequencing facilitates the classification of millions of reads of environmental {DNA} and {RNA} amplicons and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry yields up to 10 000 {DOM} molecular formulae in a marine water sample. Linking this detailed biological and chemical information is a crucial first step toward a mechanistic understanding of the role of microorganisms in the marine carbon cycle. In this study, we interpreted the complex microbiological and molecular information via a novel combination of multivariate statistics. We were able to reveal distinct relationships between the key factors of organic matter cycling along a latitudinal transect across the North Sea. Total {BC} and {DOM} composition were mainly driven by mixing of distinct water masses and presumably retain their respective terrigenous imprint on similar timescales on their way through the North Sea. The active microbial community, however, was rather influenced by local events and correlated with specific {DOM} molecular formulae indicative of compounds that are easily degradable. These trends were most pronounced on the highest resolved level, that is, operationally defined ‘species’, reflecting the functional diversity of microorganisms at high taxonomic resolution.},

	abstract = {The bacterial cell wall is critical for the determination of cell shape during growth and division, and maintains the mechanical integrity of cells in the face of turgor pressures several atmospheres in magnitude. Across the diverse shapes and sizes of the bacterial kingdom, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan, a macromolecular network of sugar strands crosslinked by short peptides. Peptidoglycan’s central importance to bacterial physiology underlies its use as an antibiotic target and has motivated genetic, structural, and cell biological studies of how it is robustly assembled during growth and division. Nonetheless, extensive investigations are still required to fully characterize the key enzymatic activities in peptidoglycan synthesis and the chemical composition of bacterial cell walls. High Performance Liquid Chromatography ({HPLC}) is a powerful analytical method for quantifying differences in the chemical composition of the walls of bacteria grown under a variety of environmental and genetic conditions, but its throughput is often limited. Here, we present a straightforward procedure for the isolation and preparation of bacterial cell walls for biological analyses of peptidoglycan via {HPLC} and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography ({UPLC}), an extension of {HPLC} that utilizes pumps to deliver ultra-high pressures of up to 15,000 psi, compared with 6,000 psi for {HPLC}. In combination with the preparation of bacterial cell walls presented here, the low-volume sample injectors, detectors with high sampling rates, smaller sample volumes, and shorter run times of {UPLC} will enable high resolution and throughput for novel discoveries of peptidoglycan composition and fundamental bacterial cell biology in most biological laboratories with access to an ultracentrifuge and {UPLC}.},

	abstract = {As one of the final steps in the bacterial growth cycle, daughter cells must be released from one another by cutting the shared peptidoglycan wall that separates them. In Escherichia coli, this delicate operation is performed by several peptidoglycan hydrolases, consisting of multiple amidases, lytic transglycosylases, and endopeptidases. The interactions among these enzymes and the molecular mechanics of how separation occurs without lysis are unknown. We show here that deleting the endopeptidase {PBP} 4 from strains lacking {AmiC} produces long chains of unseparated cells, indicating that {PBP} 4 collaborates with the major peptidoglycan amidases during cell separation. Another endopeptidase, {PBP} 7, fulfills a secondary role. These functions may be responsible for the contributions of {PBPs} 4 and 7 to the generation of regular cell shape and the production of normal biofilms. In addition, we find that the E. coli peptidoglycan amidases may have different substrate preferences. When the dd-carboxypeptidase {PBP} 5 was deleted, thereby producing cells with higher levels of pentapeptides, mutants carrying only {AmiC} produced a higher percentage of cells in chains, while mutants with active {AmiA} or {AmiB} were unaffected. The results suggest that {AmiC} prefers to remove tetrapeptides from peptidoglycan and that {AmiA} and {AmiB} either have no preference or prefer pentapeptides. Muropeptide compositions of the mutants corroborated this latter conclusion. Unexpectedly, amidase mutants lacking {PBP} 5 grew in long twisted chains instead of straight filaments, indicating that overall septal morphology was also defective in these strains.},

We recently detected {PG} in Chlamydia trachomatis by a new metabolic cell wall labeling method, however efforts to purify {PG} from pathogenic Chlamydiae have remained unsuccessful. Pathogenic chlamydial species are known to activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 ({NOD}2) innate immune receptors by as yet uncharacterized ligands, which are presumed to be {PG} fragments (muramyl di- and tripeptides). We used the {NOD}2-dependent activation of {NF}-κB by C. trachomatis-infected cell lysates as a biomarker for the presence of {PG} fragments within specific lysate fractions. We designed a new method of muropeptide isolation consisting of a double filtration step coupled with reverse-phase {HPLC} fractionation of Chlamydia-infected {HeLa} cell lysates. Fractions that displayed {NOD}2 activity were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, confirming the presence of muramyl di- and tripeptides in Chlamydia-infected cell lysate fractions. Moreover, the mass spectrometry data of large muropeptide fragments provided evidence that transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions occur in pathogenic Chlamydiae. These results reveal the composition of chlamydial {PG} and disprove the "glycanless peptidoglycan" hypothesis.},

To investigate cell-associated bacteriolytic enzymes for atl gene products, proteins were extracted from the cells as follows. The cells were exposed to 3 M {LiCl} followed by 4\% {SDS}. Thereafter, the cells were disrupted and again extracted with 4\% {SDS}. Whole {SDS}-stable cell-associated bacteriolytic proteins were extracted without disrupting the cells. Exposure to 3 M {LiCl} released major 138-, 115-, 85-, 62- and 51-{kDa} bacteriolytic proteins, and subsequent 4\% {SDS} extraction released major 138- and 115-{kDa} bacteriolytic proteins. These bacteriolytic proteins were missing in extracts of atl mutant {RUSAL}2 (S. aureus {RN}450 atl::Tn551). Immunoblotting studies suggest that these are all atl gene products: the 138-{kDa} protein is an {ATL} with a cleaved signal sequence; the 115- and 85-{kDa} proteins are intermediates; and the 51- and 62-{kDa} proteins are cell-associated 51-{kDa} {GL} and 62-{kDa} {AM}, respectively. The trypsin susceptibility of these proteins suggests that they are located outside the cell membrane. Differences in extractability and immunoelectron microscopic studies suggest that atl gene products are associated with cells in two different ways, {LiCl} extractable and non extractable. We suggest that the 138-{kDa} {ATL} undergoes processing through intermediate proteins (115- and 85-{kDa} proteins) to mature as the active cell cluster-dispersing enzymes 51-{kDa} {GL} and 62-{kDa} {AM} on the cell surface.},

Cell wall structural dynamics allowing growth and division, while maintaining integrity is a basic problem governing the life of bacteria. The polymer peptidoglycan is the main structural component for most bacteria and is made up of glycan strands that are cross-linked by peptide side chains. Despite study and speculation over many years, peptidoglycan architecture has remained largely elusive. Here, we show that the model rod-shaped bacterium Bacillus subtilis has glycan strands up to 5 μm, longer than the cell itself and 50 times longer than previously proposed. Atomic force microscopy revealed the glycan strands to be part of a peptidoglycan architecture allowing cell growth and division. The inner surface of the cell wall has a regular macrostructure with ≈50 nm-wide peptidoglycan cables [average 53 ± 12 nm (n = 91)] running basically across the short axis of the cell. Cross striations with an average periodicity of 25 ± 9 nm (n = 96) along each cable are also present. The fundamental cabling architecture is also maintained during septal development as part of cell division. We propose a coiled-coil model for peptidoglycan architecture encompassing our data and recent evidence concerning the biosynthetic machinery for this essential polymer.},

Diet is a recognized risk factor in the {NAFLD} spectrum, which includes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}) and fibrosis. Low hepatic copper (Cu) was recently linked to clinical {NAFLD}/{NASH} severity. Simple sugar consumption including sucrose and fructose is implicated in {NAFLD}, while consumption of these macronutrients also decreases liver Cu levels. Though dietary sugar and low Cu are implicated in {NAFLD}, transcript-level responses that connect diet and pathology are not established. We have developed a mature rat model of {NAFLD} induced by dietary Cu deficiency, human-relevant high sucrose intake (30\% w/w) or both factors in combination. Compared to the control diet with adequate Cu and 10\% (w/w) sucrose, rats fed either high-sucrose or low-Cu diet had increased hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrogenesis, including hepatic stellate cell activation, while the combination of diet factors also increased {ATP} citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase gene transcription (fold change {\textgreater} 2, P {\textless} 0.02). Low dietary Cu decreased hepatic and serum Cu (P ≤ 0.05), promoted lipid peroxidation and induced {NAFLD}-like histopathology, while the combined factors also induced fasting hepatic insulin resistance and liver damage. Neither low Cu nor 30\% sucrose in the diet led to enhanced weight gain. Taken together, transcript profiles, histological and biochemical data indicate that low Cu and high sucrose promote hepatic gene expression and physiological responses associated with {NAFLD} and {NASH}, even in the absence of obesity or severe steatosis.},

	abstract = {Optical spectroscopy at the ultimate limit of a single molecule has grown over the past dozen years into a powerful technique for exploring the individual nanoscale behavior of molecules in complex local environments. Observing a single molecule removes the usual ensemble average, allowing the exploration of hidden heterogeneity in complex condensed phases as well as direct observation of dynamical state changes arising from photophysics and photochemistry, without synchronization. This article reviews the experimental techniques of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with emphasis on studies at room temperature where the same single molecule is studied for an extended period. Key to successful single-molecule detection is the need to optimize signal-to-noise ratio, and the physical parameters affecting both signal and noise are described in detail. Four successful microscopic methods including the wide-field techniques of epifluorescence and total internal reflection, as well as confocal and near-field optical scanning microscopies are described. In order to extract the maximum amount of information from an experiment, a wide array of properties of the emission can be recorded, such as polarization, spectrum, degree of energy transfer, and spatial position. Whatever variable is measured, the time dependence of the parameter can yield information about excited state lifetimes, photochemistry, local environmental fluctuations, enzymatic activity, quantum optics, and many other dynamical effects. Due to the breadth of applications now appearing, single-molecule spectroscopy and microscopy may be viewed as useful new tools for the study of dynamics in complex systems, especially where ensemble averaging or lack of synchronization may obscure the details of the process under study.},

They lack the cell-division protein {FtsZ}, and the existence of peptidoglycan ({PG}) in their cell wall has been highly controversial. {FtsZ} and {PG} together function in orchestrating cell division and maintaining cell shape in almost all other bacteria. Using electron cryotomography, mass spectrometry and fluorescent labelling dyes, here we show that some environmental chlamydiae have cell wall sacculi consisting of a novel {PG} type. Treatment with fosfomycin (a {PG} synthesis inhibitor) leads to lower infection rates and aberrant cell shapes, suggesting that {PG} synthesis is crucial for the chlamydial life cycle. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the presence of {PG} in a member of the Chlamydiae. They also present a unique example of a bacterium with a {PG} sacculus but without {FtsZ}, challenging the current hypothesis that it is the absence of a cell wall that renders {FtsZ} non-essential.},

	abstract = {While vegetative Bacillus subtilis cells and mature spores are both surrounded by a thick layer of peptidoglycan ({PG}, a polymer of glycan strands cross-linked by peptide bridges), it has remained unclear whether {PG} surrounds prespores during engulfment. To clarify this issue, we generated a slender Δ{ponA} mutant that enabled high-resolution electron cryotomographic imaging. Three-dimensional reconstructions of whole cells in near-native states revealed a thin {PG}-like layer extending from the lateral cell wall around the prespore throughout engulfment. Cryotomography of purified sacculi and fluorescent labelling of {PG} in live cells confirmed that {PG} surrounds the prespore. The presence of {PG} throughout engulfment suggests new roles for {PG} in sporulation, including a new model for how {PG} synthesis might drive engulfment, and obviates the need to synthesize a {PG} layer de novo during cortex formation. In addition, it reveals that B. subtilis can synthesize thin, Gram-negative-like {PG} layers as well as its thick, archetypal Gram-positive cell wall. The continuous transformations from thick to thin and back to thick during sporulation suggest that both forms of {PG} have the same basic architecture (circumferential). Endopeptidase activity may be the main switch that governs whether a thin or a thick {PG} layer is assembled.},

	abstract = {Peptidoglycan is an essential and highly conserved mesh structure that surrounds bacterial cells. It plays a critical role in retaining a defined cell shape and, in the case of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, it lies at the interface between bacterial cells and the host organisms. Intriguingly, bacteria can metabolically incorporate unnatural D-amino acids into the peptidoglycan stem peptide directly from the surrounding media, a process mediated by penicillin binding proteins ({PBPs}). Metabolic peptidoglycan remodeling via unnatural D-amino acids has provided unique insight into peptidoglycan biosynthesis of live bacteria and has also served as the basis of a synthetic immunology strategy with potential therapeutic implications. A striking feature of this process is the vast promiscuity displayed by {PBPs} in tolerating entirely unnatural sidechains. Yet, the chemical space and physical features of this sidechain promiscuity has not been systematically determined. In this report, we designed and synthesized a library of variants displaying diverse sidechains to comprehensively establish the tolerability of unnatural D-amino acids by {PBPs} in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. In addition, nine Bacillus subtilis {PBP}-null mutants were evaluated with the goal of identifying a potential primary {PBP} responsible for unnatural D-amino acid incorporation and gaining insight into temporal control of {PBP} activity. Together, we have empirically established the scope of physical parameters that govern metabolic incorporation of unnatural D-amino acids into bacterial peptidoglycan.},

The {EGFPi} proteins were purified and tested for their efficacy as a novel fluorescent biosensor.

	abstract = {Background
Lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) comprises the outer cell wall of all gram-negative bacteria. It consists of an oligosaccharide core and lipid A. All {LPS}-induced biological responses are lipid A-dependent. Once released, {LPS} triggers a host systemic inflammatory response that leads to septic shock. Binding studies have helped to reveal some of the molecular interactions behind septic shock. Such studies have employed methods of labeling bacterial {LPS} with either radiochemicals or fluorescent dyes. Poor labeling of the {LPS} has resulted in the use of high concentrations of {LPS} in order to detect its binding.
Methods
In this study, we have devised a new methodology for labeling {LPS}, using hydrazide and galactose oxidase in order to oxidize galactose residues to aldehyde groups in the oligosaccharide core of the {LPS}.
Results
We have managed to generate a conjugate that is highly fluorescent ({LPS}-to-Alexa 488 labeling ratio of 1:5) and biologically active.
Conclusions
For the first time, this probe has enabled us to detect {LPS} binding even at pg/ml concentrations. Using this methodology, any Alexa-hydrazide dye can be conjugated to {LPS}, providing us with novel probes for imaging studies. Cytometry 41:316–320, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This is predominately because it is easy to culture and manipulate and also because its plasticity in feeding behaviour allows it to represent a broad range of free-living heterotrophic protists. Prey preferences of this versatile, but selective, predator have been well documented. However, our ability to determine the factors driving prey selectivity is limited by a poor understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying O. marina feeding. Within this study, we explore the known aspects of O. marina feeding behaviour and highlight areas that require further research to exploit this species as an effective model protist predator.},

Ecologists who study environments and biotic communities in which protozoa are im portant should find this book especially useful. During the last decade it has become clear that protozoa play important roles in natural eco systems, but few ecologists have a feeling for the functional properties and the diversity of these organisms. Protozoa pose or exemplify many general problems of population and community ecology, and of evo lutionary biology. In most respects the general ecological properties of protozoa are not fundamentally different from those of larger organisms; yet, due to their small size, short generation times, and ubiquitous oc currence they often present ecological phenomena in a new and dif ferent light. To this should be added that protozoa are well-suited for experimental work. Despite these advantages, the study of protozoa has played a relatively modest role in the development of ecology and ev olutionary biology, primarily, I believe, because most ecologists are unfamiliar with these organisms. I hope this book will attract more attention to these favorable characteristics of protozoa. I also hope that this book may make protozoologists aware of new aspects of their pet organisms. For a long time (that is, until the fun damental distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells was rec ognized) protozoa were believed to represent the simplest form of life. They were therefore extensively used for the experimental study of basic questions of cell biology.},

	abstract = {Grazing mortality of the marine phytoplankton Synechococcus is dominated by planktonic protists, yet rates of consumption and factors regulating grazer-Synechococcus interactions are poorly understood. One aspect of predator-prey interactions for which little is known are the mechanisms by which Synechococcus avoids or resists predation and, in turn, how this relates to the ability of Synechococcus to support growth of protist grazer populations. Grazing experiments conducted with the raptorial dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina and phylogenetically diverse Synechococcus isolates (strains {WH}8102, {CC}9605, {CC}9311, and {CC}9902) revealed marked differences in grazing rates—specifically that {WH}8102 was grazed at significantly lower rates than all other isolates. Additional experiments using the heterotrophic nanoflagellate Goniomonas pacifica and the filter-feeding tintinnid ciliate Eutintinnis sp. revealed that this pattern in grazing susceptibility among the isolates transcended feeding guilds and grazer taxon. Synechococcus cell size, elemental ratios, and motility were not able to explain differences in grazing rates, indicating that other features play a primary role in grazing resistance. Growth of heterotrophic protists was poorly coupled to prey ingestion and was influenced by the strain of Synechococcus being consumed. Although Synechococcus was generally a poor-quality food source, it tended to support higher growth and survival of G. pacifica and O. marina relative to Eutintinnis sp., indicating that suitability of Synechococcus varies among grazer taxa and may be a more suitable food source for the smaller protist grazers. This work has developed tractable model systems for further studies of grazer-Synechococcus interactions in marine microbial food webs.},

This bacterium has been regarded to be widely present in terrestrial and freshwater environments, but not in open ocean environments. Our purpose was to clarify its presence in open ocean, and their genotypic and physiological characteristics were compared with those of isolates from clinical, animal, and freshwater sources. Water samples were collected from freshwater, bays, and offshore environments in Japan. Sixty-two isolates, including 26 from the open ocean, were identified as P. aeruginosa by phenotypic characteristics and the {BD} Phoenix System. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ({PFGE}) was performed on all strains, together with 21 clinical and 8 animal strains. The results showed that open ocean strains are composed of a few genotypes, which are separated from other strains. Although some clinical isolates made a cluster, other strains tended to mix together. Different antibiotypes were observed among marine isolates that had similar {PFGE} and serotyping patterns. Some were multidrug-resistant. Laboratory-based microcosm study were carried out to see the responses of P. aeruginosa toward increased {NaCl} concentrations in deionized water ({DW}). Marine strains showed better survival with the increase, whereas river and clinical strains were suppressed by the increase. These findings illustrate the potential significance of open ocean as a possible reservoir of P. aeruginosa, and there may be clones unique to this environment. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence and characterization of P. aeruginosa in the open ocean.},

	abstract = {Cross-flow ultrafiltration techniques have been used to extract colloidal organic carbon ({COC}) from seawater and to investigate different molecular weight fractions of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}). Using a high-temperature catalytic oxidation ({HTCO}) method, {DOC} and {COC} of seawater in the Gulf of Mexico were measured during a R/V Gyre cruise in June 1992. {DOC} concentrations in surface water varied from 131 μM at a near-shore station (water depth ∼ 20 m) to 83 μM at an off-shore station (water depth ∼ 1550 m). {DOC} concentrations show statistically significant correlations with apparent oxygen utilization ({AOU}), as well as with temperature. However, as a upper limit, only 20–30\% of the oxygen consumption could be due to dissolved organic carbon oxidation. Furthermore, a good correlation between {DOC} and {AOU} existed only in the upper water column across the pycnocline, which we ascribed to lateral exchange processes. Water mixing can be quite important in controlling the distribution of {DOC} and the relationship between {DOC} and {AOU} in the water column.

Concentrations of {COC} \&gt; 1000 Dalton ranged from 20 to 69 μM, while {COC} \&gt; 10,000 Dalton ranged from 4 to 16 μM in the study area. On average, {COC} (\&gt; 1000 Dalton) comprised about 45\% of the initial {DOC}, and the mass concentration of colloids was \&gt; 1 mg l−1. This was one order of magnitude higher than the concentration of suspended particulate matter, and indicates that {COC} may be an important component of the carbon cycle in the ocean. The relative abundance of {COC} (both \&gt; 1000 and \&gt; 10,000 Dalton) decreased from surface water to deep water, not only in terms of concentration but also relative to total {DOC}. The measurement of molecular weight distributions indicated that ∼ 35\% of the initial {DOC} was in the 1000 –10,000 Dalton fraction, while only about 10\% was in the \&gt; 10,000 Dalton fraction, leaving approximately 55\% in the truly dissolved fraction (i.e. \&lt; 1000 Dalton).},

Here we report that the activity of naturally occurring viral populations in an {HNLC} coastal upwelling system can regenerate sufficient concentrations of dissolved Fe to support the growth of the native phytoplankton community. When combined with studies that have demonstrated that Fe in virus-mediated lysates of heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria is highly bioavailable to model marine plankton, our data demonstrate that viral activity in this marine system (and potentially others) is critical to the recycling of organically complexed Fe that supports as much as 90\% of primary production in {HNLC} surface waters.},

Surprisingly efficient microbial transformation of labile into stable forms of {DOM} has been shown previously, implying that microorganisms apparently produce far more {RDOM} than needed to sustain the global pool. Here we show, by assessing the microbial formation and transformation of {DOM} in unprecedented molecular detail for 3 years, that most of the microbial {DOM} is different from {RDOM} in the ocean. Only {\textless}0.4\% of the net community production is channelled into a form of {DOM} that is undistinguishable from oceanic {RDOM}. Our study provides a molecular background for global models on the production, turnover and accumulation of marine {DOM}.

	abstract = {Dilution solves the recalcitrance question
The deep ocean is full of dissolved organic carbon, some of which has remained unchanged for thousands of years. What makes these compounds so resistant to microbial degradation? Perhaps their chemical structures make them intrinsically difficult to metabolize? In contrast, Arrieta et al. show that they are simply too dilute to be viable sources of energy for microorganisms (see the Perspective by Middleburg). Further experiments show that if these seemingly recalcitrant organic molecules are concentrated, the ambient microbes can consume them.
Science, this issue p. 331; see also p. 290
Oceanic dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) is the second largest reservoir of organic carbon in the biosphere. About 72\% of the global {DOC} inventory is stored in deep oceanic layers for years to centuries, supporting the current view that it consists of materials resistant to microbial degradation. An alternative hypothesis is that deep-water {DOC} consists of many different, intrinsically labile compounds at concentrations too low to compensate for the metabolic costs associated to their utilization. Here, we present experimental evidence showing that low concentrations rather than recalcitrance preclude consumption of a substantial fraction of {DOC}, leading to slow microbial growth in the deep ocean. These findings demonstrate an alternative mechanism for the long-term storage of labile {DOC} in the deep ocean, which has been hitherto largely ignored.
Dilution is the reason why dissolved organic carbon in the deep ocean is not readily consumed by microbes. [Also see Perspective by Middleburg]

We explored the molecular structure of marine dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) for thermogenic signatures in different water masses of the Southern Ocean. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry via the Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance technique ({FT}-{ICR}-{MS}) revealed the presence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) dissolved in the abyssal ocean. More than 200 different {PAHs} were discerned, most of them consisting of seven condensed rings with varying numbers of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and aliphatic functional groups. These unambiguously thermogenic compounds were homogenously distributed in the deep sea, but depleted at the sea surface. Based on the structural information alone, petrogenic and pyrogenic compounds cannot be distinguished. Surface depletion of the {PAHs} and first estimates for their turnover rate (\&gt; 1.2 · 1012 mol C per year) point toward a primarily petrogenic source, possibly deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which is thus far speculative because the fluxes of combustion-derived and petrogenic matter to the ocean are not well constrained.

	abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological organisms of the world's oceans. Viral infections are a substantial source of mortality in a range of organisms—including autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton—but their impact on the deep ocean and benthic biosphere is completely unknown. Here we report that viral production in deep-sea benthic ecosystems worldwide is extremely high, and that viral infections are responsible for the abatement of 80\% of prokaryotic heterotrophic production. Virus-induced prokaryotic mortality increases with increasing water depth, and beneath a depth of 1,000 m nearly all of the prokaryotic heterotrophic production is transformed into organic detritus. The viral shunt, releasing on a global scale 0.37–0.63 gigatonnes of carbon per year, is an essential source of labile organic detritus in the deep-sea ecosystems. This process sustains a high prokaryotic biomass and provides an important contribution to prokaryotic metabolism, allowing the system to cope with the severe organic resource limitation of deep-sea ecosystems. Our results indicate that viruses have an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, in deep-sea metabolism and the overall functioning of the largest ecosystem of our biosphere.},

Our modular synthesis protocol gives easy access to a library of different {FDAAs} made with commercially available fluorophores and diamino acid starting materials. Molecules can be synthesized in a typical chemistry laboratory in 2–3 d using standard chemical transformations. The simple labeling procedure involves the addition of the {FDAAs} to a bacterial sample for the desired labeling duration and stopping further label incorporation by fixing the cells with cold 70\% (vol/vol) ​ethanol or by washing away excess dye. We discuss several scenarios for the use of these labels in fluorescence microscopy applications, including short or long labeling durations, and the combination of different labels in pure culture (e.g., for 'virtual time-lapse' microscopy) or in situ labeling of complex environmental samples. Depending on the experiment, {FDAA} labeling can take as little as 30 s for a rapidly growing species such as Escherichia coli.},

There is increasing evidence that intrinsically labile amino acids are present in old marine sediments as part of a refractory network of peptide-like material. We used amino acid enantiomers to identify the contribution of amino acids from bacterial cell walls to {THAA} in organic matter ranging from relatively young to 18,000 yr old. The ratio of D/L-amino acids increased with depth in the sediment mixed layer. Application of a transport-racemization-degradation model excludes a significant production of D-amino acids by racemization and implies in situ bacterial production as the main source. Amino acids associated with a refractory pool of bacterial cell walls could account for approximately one third of the {THAA} deeper in the sediments. We propose that in situ bacterial production and the primary flux of labile organic matter from the water column result in a small but highly reactive pool of amino acids in the surface mixed sediment only, whereas amino acids associated with refractory cell walls persist in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {Peptidoglycan (murein) is a major essential and specific constituent of the bacterial cell wall. Its main function is to protect cells against the internal osmotic pressure and to maintain the characteristic cell shape. It also serves as a platform for the anchoring of specific proteins and other cell wall components. This giant macromolecule is composed of long glycan chains cross-linked by short peptides. Any alteration of the disaccharide-peptide basic unit results in a global change of peptidoglycan structure and properties. Such global variations are encountered in nature as conserved variations along phyletic lines but have sometimes been acquired as a result of mutations or as a mechanism of resistance against cell-wall targeted antibiotics. During bacterial cell growth and division, the peptidoglycan mesh is constantly broken down by a set of highly specific hydrolases in a maturation process allowing insertion of newly synthesized units in the pre-existing polymerized material. Depending on the bacterial species considered, degradation fragments are either released in the growth medium or efficiently re-utilized for synthesis of new murein in a sequence of events termed the recycling pathway. Peptidoglycan is one of the main pathogen-associated molecular patterns recognized by the host innate immune system. Variations of the structure and metabolism of this cell wall component have been exploited by host defense mechanisms for detection/identification of invading bacterial species. Modification of the peptidoglycan structure could also represent a mechanism allowing bacteria to escape these host defense systems.},

	abstract = {Bacteria growing on marine particles generally have higher densities and cell-specific activities than free-living bacteria. Since rapidity of phage adsorption is dependent on host density, while infection productivity is a function of host physiological status, we hypothesized that marine particles are sites of elevated phage production. In the present study, organic-matter-rich agarose beads and a marine phage-host pair (Cellulophaga sp., {PhiS}(M)) were used as a model system to examine whether bacterial colonization of particles increases phage production. While no production of phages was observed in plain seawater, the presence of beads enhanced attachment and growth of bacteria, as well as phage production. This was observed because of extensive lysis of bacteria in the presence of beads and a subsequent increase in phage abundance both on beads and in the surrounding water. After 12 h, extensive phage lysis reduced the density of attached bacteria; however, after 32 h, bacterial abundance increased again. Reexposure to phages and analyses of bacterial isolates suggested that this regrowth on particles was by phage-resistant clones. The present demonstration of elevated lytic phage production associated with model particles illustrates not only that a marine phage has the ability to successfully infect and lyse surface-attached bacteria but also that acquisition of resistance may affect temporal phage-host dynamics on particles. These findings from a model system may have relevance to the distribution of phage production in environments rich in particulate matter (e.g., in coastal areas or during phytoplankton blooms) where a significant part of phage production may be directly linked to these nutrient-rich "hot spots."},

The origins and yields of biomarkers were determined in cultured marine bacteria, and the results indicated that D-amino acids are derived from numerous macromolecules in addition to peptidoglycan and are not solely from peptidoglycan. Bacterial detritus was a major component of particulate organic matter ({POM}) and is an important source of submicronsize particles and colloids in the ocean. Peptidoglycan was a substantial component of {POM} but not of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}). Compositional differences between {POM} and {DOM} primarily reflected the selective incorporation of specific bacterial components into these reservoirs. Autotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial sources were not quantified separately, but the presence of D-aspartic acid (D-Asx) and D-serine (D-Ser) suggested that heterotrophic sources were substantial. The average reactivity of bacterial organic matter was comparable to that of the bulk organic carbon pool. Bacteria were important sources of labile, semilabile, and refractory dissolved organic carbon. Bacterial organic matter accounted for {\textasciitilde}25\% of particulate and dissolved organic carbon and {\textasciitilde}50\% of particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen.

In 2007, other researchers developed a mass weathering index ({MWI}) based on the degree of weathering of {PAHs} normalized to conserved biomarkers: if the degree of weathering of oil is 70\% or more, further attempts at bioremediation would be unjustified. The objective of our study was to measure the biodegradability of the 19-year lingering oil in laboratory microcosms. Samples of beach substrate were collected from representative sites in {PWS} contaminated with oil residues of varying weathering states according to the {MWI} model. Enough sacrificial microcosms were set up to accommodate two treatments for each site (natural attenuation and biostimulation). Results indicated that lingering oil is biodegradable. Nutrient addition stimulated biodegradation compared to natural attenuation in all treatments regardless of the degree of weathering. The most weathered oil according to the {MWI} was the most biodegradable. Substantial biodegradation occurred in the natural attenuation microcosms due to the high sediment Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen ({TKN}), which served as a nitrogen source for biodegradation. Most of the observed biodegradation was due to the presence of dissolved oxygen. Nitrogen was a limiting factor but oxygen was the predominant one.},

Both concentrations are lower than optimal values for oil biodegradation (2 to 10 mg-N L(-1) and 0.40 to 2.0 mg-P L(-1)), which suggests that they are both limiting factors for biodegradation. The lowest nitrate and {DO} values were found in the oiled pits, leading to the conclusion that microbial oil consumption was probably occurring under anoxic conditions and was associated to denitrification.

Aerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the surface is well documented and it has long been thought that the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-bearing meteoric waters into reservoirs was necessary for in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation. The occurrence of biodegraded oils in reservoirs where aerobic conditions are unlikely, together with the identification of several anaerobic microorganisms in oil fields and the discovery of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation mechanisms, suggests that anaerobic degradation processes could also be responsible. The extent of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in the world's deep petroleum reservoirs, however, remains strongly contested. Moreover, no organism has yet been isolated that has been shown to degrade hydrocarbons under the conditions found in deep petroleum reservoirs. Here we report the isolation of metabolites indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation from a large fraction of 77 degraded oil samples from both marine and lacustrine sources from around the world, including the volumetrically important Canadian tar sands. Our results therefore suggest that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation is a common process in biodegraded subsurface oil reservoirs.},

Surface oiling was recorded for randomly placed quadrats, which were then excavated and examined for subsurface oil. The cumulative area of beach contaminated by surface or subsurface oil was estimated at 11.3 ha. Surface oil varied little with tide height, but subsurface oil was more prevalent at the middle tide heights. The mass of remaining subsurface oil is conservatively estimated at 55?600 kg. Analysis of terpanes indicated that over 90\% of the surface oil and all of the subsurface oil was from the Exxon Valdez and that Monterey Formation oil deposited after the 1964 Alaska earthquake accounted for the remaining surface oil. These results indicate that oil from the Exxon Valdez remains by far the largest reservoir of biologically available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on beaches impacted by the spill and that biota dependent on these beaches risk continued exposure.},

	abstract = {Delivery of dissolved chemicals to potentially bioremediate oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill was investigated at Smith Island, Prince William Sound, Alaska. Two transects for tracer application were installed: one at a clean area and another at an oiled area. Tracer delivery occurred under ambient pressure through manifolds. Lithium in {LiBr}/sea water solution was the inert tracer, and the solution (82.6 mg/L of lithium) was released at a flow rate of 0.23 L/min for 58.5 h. While maintaining the flow rate, the solution was switched to sea water (i.e., 0.0 mg/L of lithium) for 16 h. The results show that the tracer moved landward with rising tides and seaward with falling tides. The plume got deeper moving landward and shallower moving seaward of the manifold. Thus, in situations where oil biodegradation is limited by the availability of nutrients or oxygen, applying these chemicals by this technique would allow them to reach entrapped oil seaward of the manifold from below. The seaward plume traveling speed (around 2.0 m/d) suggests that this technique is logistically feasible from a hydraulic point of view.},

	abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon ({DWH}) blowout resulted in oil transport, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) to the Gulf of Mexico shoreline. The microbial communities of these shorelines are thought to be responsible for the intrinsic degradation of {PAHs}. To investigate the Gulf Coast beach microbial community response to hydrocarbon exposure, we examined the functional gene diversity, bacterial community composition, and {PAH} degradation capacity of a heavily oiled and non-oiled beach following the oil exposure. With a non-expression functional gene microarray targeting 539 gene families, we detected 28,748 coding sequences. Of these sequences, 10\% were uniquely associated with the severely oil-contaminated beach and 6.0\% with the non-oiled beach. There was little variation in the functional genes detected between the two beaches; however the relative abundance of functional genes involved in oil degradation pathways, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}), were greater in the oiled beach. The microbial {PAH} degradation potentials of both beaches, were tested in mesocosms. Mesocosms were constructed in glass columns using sands with native microbial communities, circulated with artificial sea water and challenged with a mixture of {PAHs}. The low-molecular weight {PAHs}, fluorene and naphthalene, showed rapid depletion in all mesocosms while the high-molecular weight benzo[α]pyrene was not degraded by either microbial community. Both the heavily oiled and the non-impacted coastal communities showed little variation in their biodegradation ability for low molecular weight {PAHs}. Massively-parallel sequencing of 16S {rRNA} genes from mesocosm {DNA} showed that known {PAH} degraders and genera frequently associated with oil hydrocarbon degradation represented a major portion of the bacterial community. The observed similar response by microbial communities from beaches with a different recent history of oil exposure suggests that Gulf Coast beach communities are primed for {PAH} degradation.},

Taking advantage of the energy in even small waves, they disperse floating oil slicks into tiny droplets ({\textless}70 μm) that entrain in the water column and drift apart so that they do not re-agglomerate to re-form a floating slick. The dramatically increased surface area allows microbial access to much more of the oil, and diffusion and dilution lead to oil concentrations where natural background levels of biologically available oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus are sufficient for microbial growth and oil consumption. Dispersants are only used on substantial spills in relatively deep water (usually {\textgreater}10 m), conditions that are impossible to replicate in the laboratory. To date, laboratory experiments aimed at following the biodegradation of dispersed oil usually show only minimal stimulation of the rate of biodegradation, but principally because the oil in these experiments disperses fairly effectively without dispersant. What is needed is a test protocol that allows comparison between an untreated slick that remains on the water surface during the entire biodegradation study and dispersant-treated oil that remains in the water column as small dispersed oil droplets. We show here that when this is accomplished, the rate of biodegradation is dramatically stimulated by an effective dispersant, Corexit 9500®. Further development of this approach might result in a useful tool for comparing the full benefits of different dispersants.},

Catastrophic oil spills stimulate these organisms to ?bloom? in a reproducible fashion, and although oil does not provide bioavailable nitrogen, phosphorus or iron, there are enough of these nutrients in the sea that when dispersed oil droplets dilute to low concentrations these low levels are adequate for microbial growth. Most of the hydrocarbons in dispersed oil are degraded in aerobic marine waters with a half-life of days to months. In contrast, oil that reaches shorelines is likely to be too concentrated, have lower levels of nutrients, and have a far longer residence time in the environment. Oil that becomes entrained in anaerobic sediments is also likely to have a long residence time, although it too will eventually be biodegraded. Thus, data that encompass everything from the ecosystem to the molecular level are needed for understanding the complicated process of petroleum biodegradation in marine environments.},

Prior to this incident, no deepwater applications of dispersant had been conducted, and thus no data exist on the environmental fate of dispersants in deepwater. We used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}/{MS}) to identify and quantify one key ingredient of the dispersant, the anionic surfactant {DOSS} (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater during active flow and again after flow had ceased. Here we show that {DOSS} was sequestered in deepwater hydrocarbon plumes at 1000?1200 m water depth and did not intermingle with surface dispersant applications. Further, its concentration distribution was consistent with conservative transport and dilution at depth and it persisted up to 300 km from the well, 64 days after deepwater dispersant applications ceased. We conclude that {DOSS} was selectively associated with the oil and gas phases in the deepwater plume, yet underwent negligible, or slow, rates of biodegradation in the affected waters. These results provide important constraints on accurate modeling of the deepwater plume and critical geochemical contexts for future toxicological studies.},

Marine snow formation, incorporation of oil, and subsequent gravitational settling to the seafloor (i.e., {MOSSFA}: Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation) was a significant pathway for the distribution and fate of oil, accounting for as much as 14\% of the total oil released. Long residence times of oil on the seafloor will result in prolonged exposure by benthic organisms and economically important fish. Bioaccumulation of hydrocarbons into the food web also has been documented. Major surface processes governing the {MOSSFA} event included an elevated and extended Mississippi River discharge, which enhanced phytoplankton production and suspended particle concentrations, zooplankton grazing, and enhanced microbial mucus formation. Previous reports indicated that {MOS} sedimentation also occurred during the Tsesis and Ixtoc-I oil spills; thus, {MOSSFA} events may occur during future oil spills, particularly since 85\% of global deep-water oil exploration sites are adjacent to deltaic systems. We provide a conceptual framework of {MOSSFA} processes and identify data gaps to help guide current research and to improve our ability to predict {MOSSFA} events under different environmental conditions. Baseline time-series data and model development are urgently needed for all levels of ecosystems in regions of hydrocarbon extraction to prepare for and respond to future oil spills and to understand the impacts of oil spills on the environment.},

We found that members of the genus Cycloclasticus became predominant in the enrichment cultures. The Cycloclasticus strains isolated in this study could grow on crude oil and degraded {PAH} components of crude oil, including unsubstituted and substituted naphthalenes, dibenzothiophenes, phenanthrenes, and fluorenes. To deduce the role of Cycloclasticus strains in a coastal zone oil spill, propagation of this bacterial group on oil-coated grains of gravel immersed in seawater was investigated in beach-simulating tanks that were 1 m wide by 1.5 m long by 1 m high. The tanks were two-thirds filled with gravel, and seawater was continuously introduced into the tanks; the water level was varied between 30 cm above and 30 cm below the surface of the gravel layer to simulate a 12-h tidal cycle. The number of Cycloclasticus cells associated with the grains was on the order of 10(3) cells/g of grains before crude oil was added to the tanks and increased to 3 x 10(6) cells/g of grains after crude oil was added. The number increased further after 14 days to 10(8) cells/g of grains when nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers were added, while the number remained 3 x 10(6) cells/g of grains when no fertilizers were added. {PAH} degradation proceeded parallel with the growth of Cycloclasticus cells on the surfaces of the oil-polluted grains of gravel. These observations suggest that bacteria belonging to the genus Cycloclasticus play an important role in the degradation of petroleum {PAHs} in a marine environment.},

Cores were analyzed at high-resolution (at 2 mm and 5 mm intervals) in order to evaluate the concentration, composition and input of hydrocarbons to the seafloor. Specifically, we analyzed total organic carbon ({TOC}), aliphatic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ({PAHs}), and biomarker (hopanes, steranes, diasteranes) compounds to elucidate possible sources and transport pathways for deposition of hydrocarbons. Results showed higher hydrocarbon concentrations during 2010-2011 compared to years prior to 2010. Hydrocarbon inputs in 2010-2011 were composed of a mixture of sources including terrestrial, planktonic, and weathered oil. Our results suggest that after the {DWH} event, both soluble and highly insoluble hydrocarbons were deposited at enhanced rates in the deep-sea. We proposed two distinct transport pathways of hydrocarbon deposition: 1) sinking of oil-particle aggregates (hydrocarbon-contaminated marine snow and/or suspended particulate material), and 2) advective transport and direct contact of the deep plume with the continental slope surface sediments between 1000-1200 m.

Communities were studied by means of culturable and non-culturable methods at three horizons in the sediment (2-5 cm, 12-15 cm and 25-30 cm) in an area heavily affected by the spill. Most probable number of aerobic hydrocarbon degraders was highest in the upper zone and decreased dramatically with depth. Aromatic oxidizing nitrate-reducing bacteria counts were slightly higher than aerobes in the oxidized layer, and also decreased considerably with depth. Iron-reducing bacteria were barely detectable. The highest counts were obtained for sulfate-reducing bacteria, which represented the most relevant fraction of aromatic oxidizers, being maximal at 12-15 cm depth. The community response to high pollution levels was characterized by an increase in culturable populations active towards crude oil components despite the strong decay in the total cell counts. Analysis of whole 16S {rRNA} gene libraries obtained from the two sampling times and different depths (1460 sequences in all) showed a predominance of Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, which was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Desulfobacteraceae was the most abundant group among Deltaproteobacteria, followed by sequences affiliated with the order Myxococcales. All retrieved sequences of this order affiliated with a marine myxobacterial clade. Interestingly, sequences affiliated to the order Desulfarculales constituted half of the Deltaproteobacteria sequences retrieved from the heaviest contaminated sample. Principal coordinates analysis of 16S {rRNA} gene libraries suggested fluctuation in the community distribution with time. Changes in the abundance of certain groups such as Bacteroidetes contributed to these observed differences. Although predominance of certain metabolic types in each horizon could be delimited, a considerable overlap in the use of electron acceptors was observed, confirming that each selected zone could be influenced by more than one respiratory metabolism. Altogether, our results evidence the presence in these sediments of a microbial community with potential to respond against hydrocarbon contamination, consistent with the long pollution history of the site.},

	abstract = {Coastal marine sediments, where important biological processes take place, supply essential ecosystem services. By their location, such ecosystems are particularly exposed to human activities as evidenced by the recent Deepwater Horizon disaster. This catastrophe revealed the importance to better understand the microbial processes involved on hydrocarbon degradation in marine sediments raising strong interests of the scientific community. During the last decade, several studies have shown the key role played by microorganisms in determining the fate of hydrocarbons in oil-polluted sediments but only few have taken into consideration the whole sediment’s complexity. Marine coastal sediment ecosystems are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity, owning high biodiversity and are subjected to fluctuations in environmental conditions, especially to important oxygen oscillations due to tides. Thus, for understanding the fate of hydrocarbons in such environments, it is crucial to study microbial activities, taking into account sediment characteristics, physical-chemical factors (electron acceptors, temperature), nutrients, co-metabolites availability as well as sediment’s reworking due to bioturbation activities. Key information could be collected from in situ studies, which provide an overview of microbial processes, but it is difficult to integrate all parameters involved. Microcosm experiments allow to dissect in-depth some mechanisms involved in hydrocarbon degradation but exclude environmental complexity. To overcome these lacks, strategies have been developed, by creating experiments as close as possible to environmental conditions, for studying natural microbial communities subjected to oil pollution. We present here a review of these approaches, their results and limitation, as well as the promising future of applying “omics” approaches to characterize in-depth microbial communities and metabolic networks involved in hydrocarbon degradation. In addition, we present the main conclusions of our studies in this field.},

	abstract = {Accidental oil well blowouts have the potential to introduce large quantities of hydrocarbons into the deep sea and disperse toxic contaminants to midwater and seafloor areas over ocean-basin scales. Our ability to assess the environmental impacts of these events is currently impaired by our limited understanding of how resident communities are affected. This study examined how two treatment levels of a water accommodated fraction of crude oil affected the oxygen consumption rate of a natural, deep-sea benthic community. We also investigated the resident microbial community’s response to hydrocarbon contamination through quantification of phospholipid fatty acids ({PLFAs}) and their stable carbon isotope (δ13C) values. Sediment community oxygen consumption rates increased significantly in response to increasing levels of contamination in the overlying water of oil-treated microcosms, and bacterial biomass decreased significantly in the presence of oil. Multivariate ordination of {PLFA} compositional (mol\%) data showed that the structure of the microbial community changed in response to hydrocarbon contamination. However, treatment effects on the δ13C values of individual {PLFAs} were not statistically significant. Our data demonstrate that deep-sea benthic microbes respond to hydrocarbon exposure within 36 h.},

Iwabuchi, N. Sunairi, H. Anzai, M. Nakajima, and S. Harayama, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:5073-5077, 2000). In the present study, we examined the effects of S-2 {EPS} on the growth of indigenous marine bacteria on {AF}. Indigenous bacteria did not grow significantly in seawater containing {AF} even when nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron nutrients were supplemented. The addition of S-2 {EPS} to seawater containing nutrients and {AF} resulted in the emulsification of {AF}, promotion of the growth of indigenous bacteria, and enhancement of the degradation of {AF} by the bacteria. {PCR}-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses show that addition of S-2 {EPS} to the seawater containing nutrients and {AF} changed the composition of the bacterial populations in the seawater and that bacteria closely related to the genus Cycloclasticus became the major population. These results suggest that Cycloclasticus was responsible for the degradation of hydrocarbons in {AF}. The effects of 15 synthetic surfactants on the degradation of {AF} by indigenous marine bacteria were also examined, but enhancement of the degradation of {AF} was not significant. S-2 {EPS} was hence the most effective of the surfactants tested in promoting the biodegradation of {AF} and may thus be an attractive agent to use in the bioremediation of oil-contaminated marine environments.},

	abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon blowout, which occurred on April 20, 2010, resulted in an unprecedented oil spill. Despite a complex effort to cap the well, oil and gas spewed from the site until July 15, 2010. Although a large proportion of the hydrocarbons was depleted via natural processes and human intervention, a substantial portion of the oil remained unaccounted for and impacted multiple ecosystems throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The depth, duration and magnitude of this spill were unique, raising many questions and concerns regarding the fate of the hydrocarbons released. One major question was whether or not microbial communities would be capable of metabolizing the hydrocarbons, and if so, by what mechanisms and to what extent? In this review, we summarize the microbial response to the oil spill as described by studies performed during the past four years, providing an overview of the different responses associated with the water column, surface waters, deep-sea sediments, and coastal sands/sediments. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the microbial response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was rapid and robust, displaying common attenuation mechanisms optimized for low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, the lack of evidence for the attenuation of more recalcitrant hydrocarbon components suggests that future work should focus on both the environmental impact and metabolic fate of recalcitrant compounds, such as oxygenated oil components.},

	abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon oil spill triggered a complex cascade of microbial responses that reshaped the dynamics of heterotrophic carbon degradation and the turnover of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) in oil contaminated waters. Our results from 21-day laboratory incubations in rotating glass bottles (roller bottles) demonstrate that microbial dynamics and carbon flux in oil-contaminated surface water sampled near the spill site two weeks after the onset of the blowout were greatly affected by activities of microbes associated with macroscopic oil aggregates. Roller bottles with oil-amended water showed rapid formation of oil aggregates that were similar in size and appearance compared to oil aggregates observed in surface waters near the spill site. Oil aggregates that formed in roller bottles were densely colonized by heterotrophic bacteria, exhibiting high rates of enzymatic activity (lipase hydrolysis) indicative of oil degradation. Ambient waters surrounding aggregates also showed enhanced microbial activities not directly associated with primary oil-degradation (β-glucosidase; peptidase), as well as a twofold increase in {DOC}. Concurrent changes in fluorescence properties of colored dissolved organic matter ({CDOM}) suggest an increase in oil-derived, aromatic hydrocarbons in the {DOC} pool. Thus our data indicate that oil aggregates mediate, by two distinct mechanisms, the transfer of hydrocarbons to the deep sea: a microbially-derived flux of oil-derived {DOC} from sinking oil aggregates into the ambient water column, and rapid sedimentation of the oil aggregates themselves, serving as vehicles for oily particulate matter as well as oil aggregate-associated microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities associated with Arctic fjord ice polluted with petroleum oils were investigated in this study. A winter field experiment was conducted in the Van Mijen Fjord (Svalbard) from February to June 2004, in which the ice was contaminated with a North Sea paraffinic oil. Holes were drilled in the ice and oil samples frozen into the ice at the start of the experiment. Samples, including cores of both oil-contaminated and clean ice, were collected from the field site 33, 74, and 112 days after oil application. The sampled cores were separated into three sections and processed for microbiological and chemical analyses. In the oil-contaminated cores, enumerations of total prokaryotic cells by fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming units ({CFU}) counts of heterotrophic prokaryotes both showed stimulation of microbial growth, while concentrations of oil-degrading prokaryotes remained at similar levels in contaminated and clean ice. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction ({PCR})-amplified bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ({DGGE}) revealed that bacterial communities in oil-contaminated ice generated fewer bands than communities in clean ice, although banding patterns changed both in contaminated and clean ice during the experimental period. Microbial communities in unpolluted ice and in cores contaminated with the paraffinic oil were examined by cloning and sequence analysis. In the contaminated cores, the communities became predominated by Gammaproteobacteria related to the genera Colwellia, Marinomonas, and Glaciecola, while clean ice included more heterogeneous populations. Chemical analysis of the oil-contaminated ice cores with determinations of n-C17/Pristane and naphthalene/phenanthrene ratios indicated slow oil biodegradation in the ice, primarily in the deeper parts of the ice with low hydrocarbon concentrations.},

	abstract = {This chapter gives an overview of current methods for the isolation of biosurfactant producing microbes. The common screening methods for biosurfactants are presented. Sampling and isolation of bacteria are the basis for screening of biosurfactant producing microbes. Hydrocarbon-contaminated sites are the most promising for the isolation of biosurfactant producing microbes, but many strains have also been isolated from undisturbed sites. In subsequent steps the isolates have to be characterized in order to identify the strains which are interesting for a further investigation. Several techniques have been developed for identifying biosurfactant producing strains. Most of them are directly based on the surface or interfacial activity of the culture supernatant. Apart from that, some screening methods explore the hydrophobicity of the cell surface. This trait also gives an indication on biosurfactant production. In recent years automation and miniaturization have led to the development of high throughput methods for screening. High throughput screening ({HTS}) for analyzing large amounts of potential candidates or whole culture collections is reflected in the end. However, no new principals have been introduced by {HTS} methods.},

Glucose produced the highest number of positive results (17 of 185 isolates). All 17 isolates produced emulsions with kerosene and 12 exhibited high emulsion-stabilizing capacity, maintaining 50\% of the original emulsion volume for 48 h. Eight of the 17 isolates reduced the growth medium surface tension below 40 {mN} m(-1) with 5 exhibiting this capacity in cell-free filtrates. Onset of biosurfactant production differed among the isolates, with some initiating synthesis during the exponential growth phase and others after the stationary phase was reached.

	abstract = {Oceanic dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) constitutes one of the largest pools of reduced carbon in the biosphere. Estimated {DOC} export from the surface ocean represents 20\% of total organic carbon flux to the deep ocean, which constitutes a primary control on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. {DOC} is the carbon component of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) and an accurate quantification of {DOM} pools, fluxes and their controls is therefore critical to understanding oceanic carbon cycling. {DOC} export is directly coupled with dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus export. However, the C:N:P stoichiometry (by atoms) of {DOM} dynamics is poorly understood. Here we study the stoichiometry of the {DOM} pool and of {DOM} decomposition in continental shelf, continental slope and central ocean gyre environments. We find that {DOM} is remineralized and produced with a C:N:P stoichiometry of 199:20:1 that is substantially lower than for bulk pools (typically {\textgreater}775:54:1), but greater than for particulate organic matter (106:16:1--the Redfield ratio). Thus for a given mass of new N and P introduced into surface water, more {DOC} can be exported than would occur at the Redfield ratio. This may contribute to the excess respiration estimated to occur in the interior ocean. Our results place an explicit constraint on global carbon export and elemental balance via advective pathways.},

In 36-day time series experiments, bacteria were grown on glucose both with and without protozoa. We measured bulk organic carbon pools and used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to characterize dissolved organic matter on a molecular level. Bacteria rapidly utilized glucose, depleting it to nondetectable levels and producing new {DOC} compounds of higher molecular weight within 2 days. Some of these new compounds, representing 3 to 5\% of the initial glucose-C, were refractory and persisted for over a month. Other new compounds were produced and subsequently used by bacteria during the lag and exponential growth phases, pointing to a dynamic cycling of organic compounds. Grazers caused a temporary spike in the {DOC} concentration consisting of labile compounds subsequently utilized by the bacteria. Grazing did not increase the complexity of the {DOC} pool already established by the bacteria but did continually decrease the particulate organic carbon pool and expedited the conversion of glucose-C to {CO}2. After 36 days, 29\% of initial glucose-C remained in pure bacteria cultures, while only 6\% remained in cultures where a grazer was present. In this study the bacteria were the primary shapers of the complex {DOC} continuum, suggesting higher trophic levels possibly have less of an impact on the qualitative composition of {DOC} than previously assumed.},

The extent of hydrolysis-induced racemization was controlled by the molecular structure of the amino acid polymer and hydrolysis conditions. Vapor-phase hydrolysis showed significantly higher racemization compared to liquid-phase hydrolysis. Without correction, hydrolysis-induced racemization resulted in overestimation of D-enantiomers and could lead to erroneous conclusions about the occurrence of D-enantiomers in natural samples. The range of racemization was determined with proteins and free amino acids, and an averaged racemization value is proposed to account for enantiomer exchange during hydrolysis.

Developing quantitative estimates of this process is critical as we can then develop better models of microbial community structure and function as well as advance our understanding of how viruses work to alter aquatic biogeochemical cycles. The virus reduction technique allows researchers to estimate the rate at which virus particles are released from the endemic microbial community. In brief, the abundance of free (extracellular) viruses is reduced in a sample while the microbial community is maintained at near ambient concentration. The microbial community is then incubated in the absence of free viruses and the rate at which viruses reoccur in the sample (through the lysis of already infected members of the community) can be quantified by epifluorescence microscopy or, in the case of specific viruses, quantitative {PCR}. These rates can then be used to estimate the rate of microbial mortality due to virus-mediated cell lysis.},

Although it is well established that host cells provide metabolic resources for virus replication, the extent to which infection reshapes host metabolism at a global level and the effect of this alteration on the cellular material released following viral lysis is less understood. To address this knowledge gap, the growth dynamics, metabolism and extracellular lysate of roseophage-infected Sulfitobacter sp. 2047 was studied using a variety of techniques, including liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS})-based metabolomics. Quantitative estimates of the total amount of carbon and nitrogen sequestered into particulate biomass indicate that phage infection redirects {\textasciitilde}75\% of nutrients into virions. Intracellular concentrations for 82 metabolites were measured at seven time points over the infection cycle. By the end of this period, 71\% of the detected metabolites were significantly elevated in infected populations, and stable isotope-based flux measurements showed that these cells had elevated metabolic activity. In contrast to simple hypothetical models that assume that extracellular compounds increase because of lysis, a profile of metabolites from infected cultures showed that {\textgreater}70\% of the 56 quantified compounds had decreased concentrations in the lysate relative to uninfected controls, suggesting that these small, labile nutrients were being utilized by surviving cells. These results indicate that virus-infected cells are physiologically distinct from their uninfected counterparts, which has implications for microbial community ecology and biogeochemistry.},

	abstract = {Antibiotics have the remarkable power to control bacterial infections. Unfortunately, widespread use, whether regarded as prudent or not, has favored the emergence and persistence of antibiotic resistant strains of human pathogenic bacteria, resulting in a global health threat. Bacteriophages (phages) are parasites that invade the cells of virtually all known bacteria. Phages reproduce by utilizing the host cell's machinery to replicate viral proteins and genomic material, generally damaging and killing the cell in the process. Thus, phage can be exploited therapeutically as bacteriolytic agents against bacteria. Furthermore, understanding of the molecular processes involved in the viral life cycle, particularly the entry and cell lysis steps, has led to the development of viral proteins as antibacterial agents. Here we review the current preclinical state of using phage-derived endolysins, virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolases, polysaccharide depolymerases, and holins for the treatment of bacterial infection. The scope of this review is a focus on the viral proteins that have been assessed for protective effects against human pathogenic bacteria in animal models of infection and disease.},

Since the amino acids in natural waters are of biological origin, they should be largely of the L-configuration. However, amino acids are slowly racemized at neutral {pH}.

Ammonium is scarce in {AMZs}, raising the hypothesis that organic nitrogen compounds may be ammonium sources for anammox. Biochemical measurements suggest that the organic compounds urea and cyanate can support anammox in {AMZs}. However, it is unclear if anammox bacteria degrade these compounds to ammonium themselves, or rely on other organisms for this process. Genes for urea degradation have not been found in anammox bacteria, and genomic evidence for cyanate use for anammox is limited to a cyanase gene recovered from the sediment bacterium Candidatus Scalindua profunda. Here, analysis of Ca. Scalindua single amplified genomes from the Eastern Tropical North Pacific {AMZ} revealed genes for urea degradation and transport, as well as for cyanate degradation. Urease and cyanase genes were transcribed, along with anammox genes, in the {AMZ} core where anammox rates peaked. Homologs of these genes were also detected in meta-omic datasets from major {AMZs} in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific and Arabian Sea. These results suggest that anammox bacteria from different ocean regions can directly access organic nitrogen substrates. Future studies should assess if and under what environmental conditions these substrates contribute to the ammonium budget for anammox.},

We addressed this challenge with a targeted metaproteomics workflow for {NtcA} and P-{II}, two nitrogen regulatory proteins, and demonstrated its application for cyanobacterial taxa within microbial samples from the Central Pacific Ocean. Using {METATRYP}, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less. The related cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus shared an average of 4.8 ± 1.9\% of their tryptic peptides, while shared intraspecies peptides were higher, 13 ± 15\% shared peptides between 12 Prochlorococcus genomes. An {NtcA} peptide was found to target multiple cyanobacteria species, whereas a P-{II} peptide showed specificity to the high-light Prochlorococcus ecotype. Distributions of {NtcA} and P-{II} in the Central Pacific Ocean were similar except at the Equator likely due to differential nitrogen stress responses between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The number of unique tryptic peptides coded for within three combined oceanic microbial metagenomes was estimated to be ∼4 × 10(7) , 1000-fold larger than an individual microbial proteome and 27-fold larger than the human proteome, yet still 20 orders of magnitude lower than the peptide diversity possible in all protein space, implying that peptide mapping algorithms should be able to withstand the added level of complexity in metaproteomic samples.},

Major Conclusion
Recent studies establish that cysteine and methionine have remarkably similar functions.

General Significance
Both cysteine and methionine serve as important cellular antioxidants, stabilize the structure of proteins, and can act as regulatory switches through reversible oxidation and reduction.},

	abstract = {Fluxes of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) through the oxygen deficient waters in the eastern tropical North Pacific were found to be relatively less attenuated with depth than elsewhere in the eastern North Pacific. The attenuation coefficient (b) for the flux was found to be 0.40 versus the composite value of 0.86 determined by Martin et al. (1987). To examine this further, sinking {POC} was collected using sediment traps and allowed to degrade in oxic and suboxic experiments. Using a kinetic model, it was found that degradation proceeded at similar rates (roughly 0.8 day−1) under oxic and suboxic conditions, but a greater fraction of bulk {POC} was resistant to degradation in the suboxic experiments (61\% vs. 23\%). Amino acids accounted for 37\% of {POC} collected at 75m, but following degradation the value dropped to 17\% and 16\% in the oxic and suboxic experiments respectively. {POC} collected from 500m was 10\% amino acids. The non-{AA} component of {POC} collected at 75m was not degraded under suboxic conditions, while under oxic conditions it was. These results suggest that microbes degrading {OC} under suboxic conditions via denitrification preferentially utilize nitrogen-rich amino acids. This preferential degradation of amino acids suggests that 9\% more nitrogen may be lost via water column denitrification than is accounted for when a more “Redfieldian” stoichiometry for {POC} is assumed.},

In this study, we compared {ETNP} water column nitrite, N*, and O2 data along the same transect for four studies ranging from 1972 to 2012. Anoxic water volume increased, and low-oxygen conditions expanded into shallower isopycnals from 1972 to 2012. A geochemical marker for cumulative N loss indicates that denitrification was highest in 2012 and the upper oxygen-deficient zone ({ODZ}) experienced the most change. Oxygen and N loss changes in the world's largest {ODZ} for 2012 could not be explained by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and decreased O2 in supply currents and increased wind-driven upwelling are likely mechanisms contributing to increased N loss and anoxia.},

Restriction fragment length polymorphism ({RFLP}) analyses yielded 549 distinct {RFLP} patterns, 268 of which could be assigned to fungi (Dikarya and zygomycetes) after sequence analyses. The remaining 281 {RFLP} patterns represented a variety of nonfungal taxa, even when using putatively fungal-specific primers. A substantial number of fungal sequences were closely related to environmental sequences from a range of other anoxic marine habitats, but distantly related to known sequences of described fungi. Community similarity analyses suggested distinctively different structures of fungal communities from normoxic sites, seasonally anoxic sites and permanently anoxic sites, suggesting different adaptation strategies of fungal communities to prevailing oxygen conditions. Additionally, we obtained 26 fungal cultures from the study sites, most of which were closely related ({\textgreater}97\% sequence similarity) to well-described Dikarya. This indicates that standard cultivation mainly produces more of what is already known. However, two of these cultures were highly divergent to known sequences and seem to represent novel fungal groups on high taxonomic levels. Interestingly, none of the cultured isolates is identical to any of the environmental sequences obtained. Our study demonstrates the importance of a multiple-primer approach combined with cultivation to obtain deeper insights into the true fungal diversity in environmental samples and to enable adequate intersample comparisons of fungal communities.},

	abstract = {In principle, tandem mass spectrometry can be used to detect and quantify the peptides present in a microbiome sample, enabling functional and taxonomic insight into microbiome metabolic activity. However, the phylogenetic diversity constituting a particular microbiome is often unknown, and many of the organisms present may not have assembled genomes. In ocean microbiome samples, with particularly diverse and uncultured bacterial communities, it is difficult to construct protein databases that contain the bulk of the peptides in the sample without losing detection sensitivity due to the overwhelming number of candidate peptides for each tandem mass spectrum. We describe a method for deriving “metapeptides” (short amino acid sequences that may be represented in multiple organisms) from shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbiome samples. In two ocean microbiome samples, we constructed site-specific metapeptide databases to detect more than one and a half times as many peptides as by searching against predicted genes from an assembled metagenome and roughly three times as many peptides as by searching against the {NCBI} environmental proteome database. The increased peptide yield has the potential to enrich the taxonomic and functional characterization of sample metaproteomes.},

Among the methods available for investigation of microbial communities, metaproteomics can approximate the activity of microorganisms by investigating the protein content of a sample. Although metaproteomics is a very powerful method, issues within the bioinformatic evaluation impede its success. In particular, construction of databases for protein identification, grouping of redundant proteins as well as taxonomic and functional annotation pose big challenges. Furthermore, growing amounts of data within a metaproteomics study require dedicated algorithms and software.

We also examine how the conclusions of a comparative analysis are influenced by the manner in which the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} data is ‘rolled up’ to the protein level, and show that divergent conclusions obtained using different rollups can be informative. Our analysis is based on two publicly available reference data sets, {BIATECH}-54 and {CPTAC}, which were developed for the purpose of assessing methods used in label-free differential proteomic studies.

Fluxes at the more oxygenated 11°{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}N station attenuate faster than within the permanent {ODZ}. Martin curve attenuation coefficients for 19.5 and 15.5°{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}N are respectively 0.59 and 0.63 and for 11°{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}N it is 0.98. At least six potential mechanisms might explain why particles sinking through the {ODZ} are more effectively transferred to depth: (M1) oxygen effects, (M2) microbial loop efficiencies and chemoautotrophy, (M3) changes in zooplankton dynamics, (M4) additions of ballast that might sorb and protect organic matter from decay (M4a) or change sinking speeds (M4b), (M5) inputs of refractory organic matter and (M6) temperature effects. These mechanisms are intertwined, and they were explored using a combination of mineral ({XPS}) and organic matter characterizations of the sinking material, shipboard incubation experiments, and evaluations of existing literature. Direct evidence was found supporting an oxygen effect and/or changes in the efficiency of the microbial loop including the addition of chemoautotrophic carbon to the sinking flux in the upper 500{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m. Less direct evidence was found for the other potential mechanisms. A simple conceptual model consistent with our and other recent data suggests that the upper {ODZ} microbial community determines the initial flux attenuation, and that zooplankton and sinking speed become more important deeper in the water column. The exact interplay between the various mechanisms remains to be further evaluated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite their recognized importance in carbon cycling in the surface ocean, the role of small cells and their detrital remains in the transfer of particulate organic matter ({POM}) to the deep ocean remains disputed. Because oligotrophic marine conditions are projected to expand under current climate trends, a better understanding of the role of small particles in the global carbon cycle is a timely goal. Here we use the lipid profiles, radiocarbon, and stable carbon isotopic signatures of lipids from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to show that in the surface ocean, lipids from submicron {POM} (here called extra-small {POM}) are distinct from larger classes of suspended {POM}. Remarkably, this distinct extra-small {POM} signature dominates the total lipids collected at mesopelagic depth, suggesting that the lipid component of mesopelagic {POM} primarily contains the exported remains of small particles. Transfer of submicron material to mesopelagic depths in this location is consistent with model results that claim the biological origin of exported carbon should be proportional to the distribution of cell types in the surface community, irrespective of cell size [Richardson {TL}, Jackson {GA} (2007) Science 315:838–840]. Our data suggest that the submicron component of exported {POM} is an important contributor to the global biological pump, especially in oligotrophic waters.},

We suggest that all primary producers, not just the large cells, can contribute to export from the surface layer of the ocean at rates proportional to their production rates.
Abundant picoplankton, thought to be too small to settle in the ocean, actually contribute to the flux of carbon to the depths in an amount proportional to their production.

Lipid biomarkers suggest that the large, fast-sinking particles found beneath the mixed layer are compositionally distinct from those found in the mixed layer and thus not directly and efficiently formed from phytoplankton cells. We postulate that they are formed from the in situ aggregation of smaller, slow-sinking particles over time in the mixed layer itself. This export pathway is likely widespread where smaller phytoplankton species dominate. Its lack of representation in biogeochemical models suggests that they may be currently overestimating the ability of the oceans to store carbon if large, fast-sinking, labile particles dominate simulated particle export.},

Here we quantify the enrichment of clusters of orthologous gene functional categories ({COG}-{FCs})$^{\textrm{4}}$, a proxy for metabolic potential, within the genomes of 3207 cultured and uncultured microbe lineages from a custom-curated genome database. Results show that, on average, 36.7\% of the variation in {COG}-{FC} enrichment is explained by taxonomic rank, with domain, phylum, class, order, family, and genus explaining, on average, 2.3\%, 12.9\%, 2.6\%, 9.4\%, 6.1\%, and 3.5\% of the variance, respectively (\textit{p}\&lt;0.001 for all). Furthermore, taxonomic rank explained 81.5\% of the variance when a only 18 of the 23 {COG}-{FC} categories were considered for analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work which quantifies the variance in metabolic potential from individual taxonomic ranks. A qualitative comparison between the {COG}-{FC} enrichments and order-level phylogenies, generated from concatenated protein sequence alignments, further supports the idea that metabolic potential is taxonomically coherent at higher taxonomic ranks. The coherence in metabolic potential at higher taxonomic ranks provides support to hypotheses which suggest that microbial lineages may be biased to occupy specific ecological or metabolic niches$^{\textrm{5}}$.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Microbes are the engines driving biogeochemical cycles. Microbial extracellular enzymatic activities ({EEAs}) are the “gatekeepers” of the carbon cycle. The total {EEA} is the sum of cell-bound (i.e., cell-attached), and dissolved (i.e., cell-free) enzyme activities. Cell-free enzymes make up a substantial proportion (up to 100\%) of the total marine {EEA}. Although we are learning more about how microbial diversity and function (including total {EEA}) will be affected by environmental changes, little is known about what factors control the importance of the abundant cell-free enzymes. Since cell-attached {EEAs} are linked to the cell, their fate will likely be linked to the factors controlling the cell’s fate. In contrast, cell-free enzymes belong to a kind of “living dead” realm because they are not attached to a living cell but still are able to perform their function away from the cell; and as such, the factors controlling their activity and fate might differ from those affecting cell-attached enzymes. This article aims to place cell-free {EEA} into the wider context of hydrolysis of organic matter, deal with recent studies assessing what controls the production, activity and lifetime of cell-free {EEA}, and what their fate might be in response to environmental stressors. This perspective article advocates the need to go “beyond the living things”, studying the response of cells/organisms to different stressors, but also to study cell-free enzymes, in order to fully constrain the future and evolution of marine biogeochemical cycles.},

Whether it also determines carbon burial rates remains controversial. We investigated the effect of varying oxygen concentrations (170 to 0 μM O2) on microbial remineralization of organic matter in seafloor sediments and on community diversity of the northwestern Crimean shelf break. This study shows that 50\% more organic matter is preserved in surface sediments exposed to hypoxia compared to oxic bottom waters. Hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decreased remineralization rates even within short periods of a few days. These conditions led to the accumulation of threefold more phytodetritus pigments within 40 years compared to the oxic zone. Bacterial community structure also differed between oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic zones. Functional groups relevant in the degradation of particulate organic matter, such as Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, changed with decreasing oxygenation, and the microbial community of the hypoxic zone took longer to degrade similar amounts of deposited reactive matter. We conclude that hypoxic bottom-water conditions—even on short time scales—substantially increase the preservation potential of organic matter because of the negative effects on benthic fauna and particle mixing and by favoring anaerobic processes, including sulfurization of matter.
Hypoxia enhances organic matter preservation in marine sediments by changing benthic communities, bioturbation, and burial rates.

	abstract = {Background
The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, having multiple ecotypes of distinct genotypic/phenotypic traits and being the first documented example of genome shrinkage in free-living organisms, offers an ideal system for studying niche-driven molecular micro-diversity in closely related microbes. The present study, through an extensive comparative analysis of various genomic/proteomic features of 6 high light ({HL}) and 6 low light ({LL}) adapted strains, makes an attempt to identify molecular determinants associated with their vertical niche partitioning.

Results
Pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in synonymous codon usage is observed exclusively in {LL} strains. Distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by 2 {LL} strains with larger genomes and G+C-content ≈ 50\% (group {LLa}), 4 {LL} strains having reduced genomes and G+C-content ≈ 35-37\% (group {LLb}), and 6 {HL} strains. Taking into account the emergence of {LLa}, {LLb} and {HL} strains (based on 16S {rRNA} phylogeny), a gradual increase in average aromaticity, {pI} values and beta- \& coil-forming propensities and a decrease in mean hydrophobicity, instability indices and helix-forming propensities of core proteins are observed. Greater variations in orthologous gene repertoire are found between {LLa} and {LLb} strains, while higher number of positively selected genes exist between {LL} and {HL} strains.

Conclusion
Strains of different Prochlorococcus groups are characterized by distinct compositional, physicochemical and structural traits that are not mere remnants of a continuous genetic drift, but are potential outcomes of a grand scheme of niche-oriented stepwise diversification, that might have driven them chronologically towards greater stability/fidelity and invoked upon them a special ability to inhabit diverse oceanic environments.},

	abstract = {Background
Protein secondary structure prediction ({SSP}) has been an area of intense research interest. Despite advances in recent methods conducted on large datasets, the estimated upper limit accuracy is yet to be reached. Since the predictions of {SSP} methods are applied as input to higher-level structure prediction pipelines, even small errors may have large perturbations in final models. Previous works relied on cross validation as an estimate of classifier accuracy. However, training on large numbers of protein chains compromises the classifier ability to generalize to new sequences. This prompts a novel approach to training and an investigation into the possible structural factors that lead to poor predictions., Here, a small group of 55 proteins termed the compact model is selected from the {CB}513 dataset using a heuristics-based approach. In a prior work, all sequences were represented as probability matrices of residues adopting each of Helix, Sheet and Coil states, based on energy calculations using the C-Alpha, C-Beta, Side-chain ({CABS}) algorithm. The functional relationship between the conformational energies computed with {CABS} force-field and residue states is approximated using a classifier termed the Fully Complex-valued Relaxation Network ({FCRN}). The {FCRN} is trained with the compact model proteins.

Results
The performance of the compact model is compared with traditional cross-validated accuracies and blind-tested on a dataset of G Switch proteins, obtaining accuracies of ∼81 \%. The model demonstrates better results when compared to several techniques in the literature. A comparative case study of the worst performing chain identifies hydrogen bond contacts that lead to Coil ⇔ Sheet misclassifications. Overall, mispredicted Coil residues have a higher propensity to participate in backbone hydrogen bonding than correctly predicted Coils.

Conclusions
The implications of these findings are: (i) the choice of training proteins is important in preserving the generalization of a classifier to predict new sequences accurately and (ii) {SSP} techniques sensitive in distinguishing between backbone hydrogen bonding and side-chain or water-mediated hydrogen bonding might be needed in the reduction of Coil ⇔ Sheet misclassifications.

Our analysis identifies significant phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition undetected by previous studies due to small sample sizes and the large inherent variability in macromolecular pools. The phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition lead to variations in carbon-to-nitrogen ratios that are consistent with independent observations. These phylogenetic differences in macromolecular and elemental composition reflect adaptations in cellular architecture and biochemistry; specifically in the cell wall, the light harvesting apparatus, and storage pools.},

Such improvements should preferably be encompassed in a freely available web-based predictor that can also be used as a standalone program.
{RESULTS}: We developed {PSORTb} version 3.0 with improved recall, higher proteome-scale prediction coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. It is the first {SCL} predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with atypical membrane/cell wall topologies. It features an improved standalone program, with a new batch results delivery system complementing its web interface. We evaluated the most accurate {SCL} predictors using 5-fold cross validation plus we performed an independent proteomics analysis, showing that {PSORTb} 3.0 is the most accurate but can benefit from being complemented by Proteome Analyst predictions.

	abstract = {De novo sequencing is a spectrum analysis approach for mass spectrometry data to discover post-translational modifications in proteins; however, such an approach is still in its infancy and is still not widely applied to proteomic practices due to its limited reliability. In this work, we describe a de novo sequencing approach for the discovery of protein modifications based on identification of the proteome {UStags} (Shen, Y.; Tolić, N.; Hixson, K. K.; Purvine, S. O.; Pasǎ-Tolić, L.; Qian, W. J.; Adkins, J. N.; Moore, R. J.; Smith, R. D. Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 1871−1882). The de novo information was obtained from Fourier-transform tandem mass spectrometry data for peptides and polypeptides from a yeast lysate, and the de novo sequences obtained were selected based on filter levels designed to provide a limited yet high quality subset of {UStags}. The {DNA}-predicted database protein sequences were then compared to the {UStags}, and the differences observed across or in the {UStags} (i.e., the {UStags}’ prefix and suffix sequences and the {UStags} themselves) were used to infer possible sequence modifications. With this de novo−{UStag} approach, we uncovered some unexpected variances within several yeast protein sequences due to amino acid mutations and/or multiple modifications to the predicted protein sequences. To determine false discovery rates, two random (false) databases were independently used for sequence matching, and ∼3\% false discovery rates were estimated for the de novo−{UStag} approach. The factors affecting the reliability (e.g., existence of de novo sequencing noise residues and redundant sequences) and the sensitivity of the approach were investigated and described. The combined de novo−{UStag} approach complements the {UStag} method previously reported by enabling the discovery of new protein modifications.},

	abstract = {Metaproteomic analyses were performed on suspended sediments collected in one coastal environment (Washington margin, Pacific Ocean, n = 5) and two oligotrophic environments (Atlantic Ocean near {BATS}, n = 5, and Pacific Ocean near {HOTS}, n = 5). Using a database of 2.3 million marine proteins developed using the {NCBI} database, 443 unique peptides were detected from which 363 unique proteins were identified. Samples from the euphotic zone contained on average 2-3x more identifiable proteins than deeper waters (150-1500 m) and these proteins were predominately from photosynthetic organisms. Diatom peptides dominate the spectra of the Washington margin while peptides from cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus sp. dominated the spectra of both oligotrophic sites. Despite differences in the exact proteins identified at each location, there is good agreement for protein function and cellular location. Proteins in surface waters code for a variety of cellular functions including photosynthesis (24\% of detected proteins), energy production (10\%), membrane production (9\%) and genetic coding and reading (9\%), and are split 60-40 between membrane proteins and intracellular cytoplasmic proteins. Sargasso Sea surface waters contain a suite of peptides consistent with proteins involved in circadian rhythms that promote both C and N fixation at night. At depth in the Sargasso Sea, both muscle-derived myosin protein and the muscle-hydrolyzing proteases deseasin {MCP}-01 and metalloprotease Mcp02 from γ-proteobacteria were observed. Deeper waters contain peptides predominately sourced from γ-proteobacteria (37\% of detected proteins) and α-proteobacteria (26\%), although peptides from membrane and photosynthetic proteins attributable to phytoplankton were still observed (13\%). Relative to surface values, detection frequencies for bacterial membrane proteins and extracellular enzymes rose from 9 to 16 and 2 to 4\% respectively below the thermocline and the overall balance between membrane proteins and intracellular proteins grows to an approximate 75-25 split. Unlike the phytoplankton membrane proteins, which are detrital in nature, the bacterial protein suite at depth is consistent with living biomass.},

The kinetics of release of monomers and oligopeptides, which are amenable to absorption by cells, is measured as either individual or total amino acids. Microbial proteases incubated with fresh sediments yield amino acids at a similar rate as gut juices from a deposit-feeding holothuroid. Amino acid release from fresh sediment was dominated by a slow hydrolysis step from a refractory substrate, which can be described with a first-order rate law. Typical rate constants for release were in the range 0.15-0.52 h-l, consistent with gut residence times of deposit feeders. The bioavailable pool of peptides had a composition resembling that of average biological tissue, but comparisons with tissue composition suggested dietary deficiency of some essential amino acids. The early stages of release exhibited significant contributions from osmolytes (e.g. glutamic acid and taurine), while a larger, more slowly released pool was anomalously low in methionine, suggesting a contribution from microbial coat proteins. Freezing the sediment led to greater yields of amino acids, which reduced the simulation of a deposit feeder’s gut but indicated a larger pool of potentially bioavailable substrate protected by some kind of matrix. This larger pool of peptide substrate was usually dominated by higher molecular weight polypeptides as measured by the Coomassie Blue method.},

Studies seeking to elucidate the biogeochemical roles of marine particles often require reliable ways to collect them from the ocean. Here, we review the oceanographic toolbox of techniques and instrumentation that are employed to collect both suspended and sinking particles. With these tools, it is possible to determine both the concentrations and vertical fluxes of important elements and individual particle types. We describe the various methods for quantifying the concentrations of particulate matter with in situ pumps, towed sampling devices, bottle collectors, and large volume capture devices. The uses of various types of flux collection platforms are discussed including surface tethered, neutrally buoyant, and bottom moored devices. We address the issues of sediment trap collection biases and the apparent inconsistencies that can arise due to differences in the temporal and spatial scales sampled by the various methodologies. Special attention is given to collection considerations made for the analysis of trace metals and isotopes, as these methodologies are of high importance to the ongoing {GEOTRACES} program which seeks to identify the processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean. With the emergence of new particle collection methodologies and the continued reliance on traditional collection methods, it is imperative that we combine these multiple approaches in ways that will help improve their accuracy and precision while enhancing their utility in advancing understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of marine particles.},

Typically, microbial activity in the deep biosphere is calculated by transport-reaction modelling of pore water solutes or from experimental measurements involving radiotracers. Here we modelled microbial activity from the degree of D:L-aspartic acid racemization in microbial necromass (remains of dead microbial biomass) in sediments up to ten million years old. This recently developed approach (D:L-amino acid modelling) does not require incubation experiments and is highly sensitive in stable, low-activity environments. We applied for the first time newly established constraints on several important input parameters of the D:L-amino acid model, such as a higher aspartic acid racemization rate constant and a lower cell-specific carbon content of sub-seafloor microorganisms. Our model results show that the pool of necromass amino acids is turned over by microbial activity every few thousand years, while the turnover times of vegetative cells are in the order of years to decades. Notably, microbial turnover times in million-year-old sediment from the Peru Margin are up to 100-fold shorter than previous estimates, highlighting the influence of microbial activities on element cycling over geologic time scales.},

	abstract = {Interactions between organic matter ({OM}) and minerals are important for the preservation of organic material in marine sediments. Recent evidence suggests that these interactions may not be due to protection of the organic matter via simple sorption to minerals, but rather that the organic matter is acting as a glue between mineral particles resulting in aggregate formation. Density fractionation into multiple density intervals is a powerful approach for looking at the patchy nature of organic matter distribution (Bock, M.J., Mayer, L.M., 2000. Mesodensity organo-clay associations in a near-shore sediment. Marine Geology 163, 65–75), because isolates with varying organic matter loadings can be obtained. The aggregate surfaces can be examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}), because this technique is restricted to the top 10 nm of the sample surface. {XPS} gives quantitative information on all the elements on the surface (except H and He) and, in addition, gives information on the chemical bonding of carbon and nitrogen. We used these techniques, along with more standard geochemical tools ({CHN}, surface area and amino acid analyses), to study a sediment sample of high organic matter content from the oxygen deficient zone off the western coast of Mexico. We found that amino acid composition indicates that the fractions get progressively more degraded as density increases, while the fraction of carbon bonded to oxygen suggests that the oxidation state of the organic matter is similar for all fractions. In addition, the comparison of surface carbon concentrations from {XPS} and {OC}:{SA} suggests that the {OM} is located in discrete spots on the surface and that as density increases ({OC}:{SA} decreases) the organic matter decreases in thickness while retaining the same proportional areal extent.},

	abstract = {Some of the most transformative discoveries promising to enable the resolution of this century's grand societal challenges will most likely arise from environmental science and particularly environmental microbiology and biotechnology. Understanding how microbes interact in situ, and how microbial communities respond to environmental changes remains an enormous challenge for science. Systems biology offers a powerful experimental strategy to tackle the exciting task of deciphering microbial interactions. In this framework, entire microbial communities are considered as metaorganisms and each level of biological information ({DNA}, {RNA}, proteins and metabolites) is investigated along with in situ environmental characteristics. In this way, systems biology can help unravel the interactions between the different parts of an ecosystem ultimately responsible for its emergent properties. Indeed each level of biological information provides a different level of characterisation of the microbial communities. Metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics and {SIP}-omics can be employed to investigate collectively microbial community structure, potential, function, activity and interactions. Omics approaches are enabled by high-throughput 21st century technologies and this review will discuss how their implementation has revolutionised our understanding of microbial communities.},

We analysed the prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) diversity and community composition present in six distinct particle size classes ranging from the pico- to the microscale (0.2 to 200 μm). Further, we studied their variations along oceanographic horizontal (from the coast to open oceanic waters) and vertical (from the ocean surface into the meso- and bathypelagic ocean) gradients. In general, prokaryotic community composition was more variable with depth than in the transition from the coast to the open ocean. Comparing the six size-fractions, distinct prokaryotic communities were detected in each size-fraction, and whereas bacteria were more diverse in the larger size-fractions, archaea were more diverse in the smaller size-fractions. Comparison of prokaryotic community composition among particle size-fractions showed that most, but not all, taxonomic groups have a preference for a certain size-fraction sustained with depth. Species sorting, or the presence of diverse ecotypes with distinct size-fraction preferences, may explain why this trend is not conserved in all taxa.},

	abstract = {Sequence-based prediction of protein secondary structure ({SS}) enjoys wide-spread and increasing use for the analysis and prediction of numerous structural and functional characteristics of proteins. The lack of a recent comprehensive and large-scale comparison of the numerous prediction methods results in an often arbitrary selection of a {SS} predictor. To address this void, we compare and analyze 12 popular, standalone and high-throughput predictors on a large set of 1975 proteins to provide in-depth, novel and practical insights. We show that there is no universally best predictor and thus detailed comparative studies are needed to support informed selection of {SS} predictors for a given application. Our study shows that the three-state accuracy (Q3) and segment overlap ({SOV}3) of the {SS} prediction currently reach 82\% and 81\%, respectively. We demonstrate that carefully designed consensus-based predictors improve the Q3 by additional 2\% and that homology modeling-based methods are significantly better by 1.5\% Q3 than ab initio approaches. Our empirical analysis reveals that solvent exposed and flexible coils are predicted with a higher quality than the buried and rigid coils, while inverse is true for the strands and helices. We also show that longer helices are easier to predict, which is in contrast to longer strands that are harder to find. The current methods confuse 1–6\% of strand residues with helical residues and vice versa and they perform poorly for residues in the β- bridge and 310-helix conformations. Finally, we compare predictions of the standalone implementations of four well-performing methods with their corresponding web servers.},

This rise in temperature has triggered hydrological and geochemical changes that increasingly release carbon-rich water into the coastal ocean via increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of the semi-permanent permafrost ubiquitous in the region. To determine the biogeochemical impacts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter ({tDOM}) on marine ecosystems we compared the nutrient stocks and bacterial communities present under ice-covered and ice-free conditions, assessed the lability of Arctic {tDOM} to coastal microbial communities from the Chukchi Sea, and identified bacterial taxa that respond to rapid increases in {tDOM}. Once thought to be predominantly refractory, we found that ∼7\% of dissolved organic carbon and ∼38\% of dissolved organic nitrogen from {tDOM} was bioavailable to receiving marine microbial communities on short 4 – 6 day time scales. The addition of {tDOM} shifted bacterial community structure toward more copiotrophic taxa and away from more oligotrophic taxa. Although no single order was found to respond universally (positively or negatively) to the {tDOM} addition, this study identified 20 indicator species as possible sentinels for increased {tDOM}. These data suggest the true ecological impact of {tDOM} will be widespread across many bacterial taxa and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated.},

A precise knowledge of the composition and changes in the proteome can yield fundamental insights into such a response. Here we report a detailed proteome analysis of the important model cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus {SS}120 after treatment with azaserine, an inhibitor of ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase ({GOGAT}), to simulate extreme nitrogen starvation. In total, 1,072 proteins, corresponding to 57\% of the theoretical proteome, were identified—the maximum proteome coverage obtained for any Prochlorococcus strain thus far. Spectral intensity, calibrated quantification by the Hi3 method, was obtained for 1,007 proteins. Statistically significant changes (P value of {\textless}0.05) were observed for 408 proteins, with the majority of proteins (92.4\%) downregulated after 8 h of treatment. There was a strong decrease in ribosomal proteins upon azaserine addition, while many transporters were increased. The regulatory proteins {PII} and {PipX} were decreased, and the global nitrogen regulator {NtcA} was upregulated. Furthermore, our data for Prochlorococcus indicate that {NtcA} also participates in the regulation of photosynthesis.

	abstract = {Unlike other marine-sedimentary manganese ore deposits, which are largely composed of manganese oxides, the primary ore at Molango (Hidalgo State, Mexico) is exclusively manganese carbonate (rhodochrosite, Mn-calcite, kutnahorite). Stable isotope studies of the carbonates from Molango provide critical new information relevant to the controversy over syngenetic and diagenetic models of stratiform manganese deposit formation. Negative δ13C values for carbonates from mineralized zones at Molango are strongly correlated with manganese content both on a whole rock scale and by mineral species. Whole rock δ13C data fall into three groups: high-grade ore = −16.4 to −11.5\%.; manganese-rich, sub-ore-grade = −5.2 to 0\%.; and unmineralized carbonates = 0 to +2.5\%. ({PDB}). δ18O data show considerable overlap in values among the three groups: +4.8 to −2.8, −5.4 to −0.3\%., and −7.4 to +6.2 ({PDB}), respectively. Isotopic data for individual co-existing minerals suggest a similar separation of δ13C values: δ13C values from calcite range from −1.1 to +0.7\%. ({PDB}), whereas values from rhodochrosite are very negative, −12.9 to −5.5\%., and values from kutnahorite or Mn-calcite are intermediate between calcite and rhodochrosite. 13C data are interpreted to indicate that calcite (i.e. unmineralized carbonate) formed from a normal marine carbon reservoir. However, 13C data for the manganese-bearing carbonates suggest a mixed seawater and organic source of carbon. The presence of only trace amounts of pyrite suggests sulfate reduction may have played a minor part in oxidizing organic matter. It is possible that manganese reduction was the predominant reaction that oxidized organic matter and that it released organic-derived {CO}2 to produce negative δ13C values and manganese carbonate mineralization.},

	abstract = {Freeze-drying (lyophilization) removes water from a frozen sample by sublimation and desorption. It can be viewed as a three-step process consisting of freezing, primary drying and secondary drying. While cryoprotectants can protect the protein from denaturation during early stages, lyoprotectants are needed to prevent protein inactivation during drying. The structural changes as a result of freeze-drying have been investigated, especially by {FTIR} (Fourier-transform {IR}) spectroscopy. In general, drying results in a decrease of α-helix and random structure and an increase in β-sheet structure. In the case of basic fibroblast growth factor and γ-interferon, enhanced {FTIR} showed large conformational changes and aggregation during freeze-drying, which could be prevented by using sucrose as a lyoprotectant. It is now well established that structural changes during freeze-drying are responsible for low activity of freeze-dried powders in nearly anhydrous media. Strategies such as salt activation can give ‘activated’ enzyme powders, e.g. salt-activated thermolysin-catalysed regioselective acylation of taxol to give a more soluble derivative for therapeutic use. In the presence of moisture, freeze-dried proteins can undergo disulphide interchange and other reactions which lead to inactivation.

	abstract = {While peptide identifications in mass spectrometry ({MS})-based shotgun proteomics are mostly obtained using database search methods, high-resolution spectrum data from modern {MS} instruments nowadays offer the prospect of improving the performance of computational de novo peptide sequencing. The major benefit of de novo sequencing is that it does not require a reference database to deduce full-length or partial tag-based peptide sequences directly from experimental tandem mass spectrometry spectra. Although various algorithms have been developed for automated de novo sequencing, the prediction accuracy of proposed solutions has been rarely evaluated in independent benchmarking studies. The main objective of this work is to provide a detailed evaluation on the performance of de novo sequencing algorithms on high-resolution data. For this purpose, we processed four experimental data sets acquired from different instrument types from collision-induced dissociation and higher energy collisional dissociation ({HCD}) fragmentation mode using the software packages Novor, {PEAKS} and {PepNovo}. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is also tested on ground truth data based on simulated spectra generated from peak intensity prediction software. We found that Novor shows the overall best performance compared with {PEAKS} and {PepNovo} with respect to the accuracy of correct full peptide, tag-based and single-residue predictions. In addition, the same tool outpaced the commercial competitor {PEAKS} in terms of running time speedup by factors of around 12–17. Despite around 35\% prediction accuracy for complete peptide sequences on {HCD} data sets, taken as a whole, the evaluated algorithms perform moderately on experimental data but show a significantly better performance on simulated data (up to 84\% accuracy). Further, we describe the most frequently occurring de novo sequencing errors and evaluate the influence of missing fragment ion peaks and spectral noise on the accuracy. Finally, we discuss the potential of de novo sequencing for now becoming more widely used in the field.},

The networks are further integrated with local dynamic programming to solve the complex optimization task of de novo sequencing. We evaluated the method on a wide variety of species and found that {DeepNovo} considerably outperformed state of the art methods, achieving 7.7–22.9\% higher accuracy at the amino acid level and 38.1–64.0\% higher accuracy at the peptide level. We further used {DeepNovo} to automatically reconstruct the complete sequences of antibody light and heavy chains of mouse, achieving 97.5–100\% coverage and 97.2–99.5\% accuracy, without assisting databases. Moreover, {DeepNovo} is retrainable to adapt to any sources of data and provides a complete end-to-end training and prediction solution to the de novo sequencing problem. Not only does our study extend the deep learning revolution to a new field, but it also shows an innovative approach in solving optimization problems by using deep learning and dynamic programming.},

Inorganic nitrogen concentrations are consequently very low in surface waters of temperate ocean gyres, yet fixed nitrogen persists in the form of dissolved organic matter. The small, rapidly cycling organic compounds fundamental to microbial and planktonic growth (such as free amino acids, amines and urea) account for only a minor fraction of total dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}). In contrast, the vast majority of {DON}, especially in the deep ocean, resides in the form of nitrogenous substances that are resistant to biological degradation. These substances, which represent an enormous reservoir of fixed nitrogen, are not readily identified by conventional biochemical techniques, but have been assumed to consist largely of structurally complex macromolecules resulting from the degradation and spontaneous abiotic condensation of biochemical precursors. Here we present 15N {NMR} measurements that contradict this view. Our results show that most higher-molecular-weight {DON} in the ocean exists in amide form, rather than as a collection of nitrogen heterocycles that might be indicative of spontaneous condensation products. Because these amides are unlikely to form abiotically, the bulk of the ocean's {DON} reservoir appears to derive directly from degradation-resistant biomolecules.},

This study investigated the diversity of {OMZ} protist communities in two biomass size fractions ({\textgreater}30 and 30-1.6 μm filters) from the world's largest permanent {OMZ} in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Diversity was quantified via Illumina {MiSeq} sequencing of V4 region of 18S {SSU} {rRNA} genes in samples spanning oxygen gradients at two stations. Alveolata and Rhizaria dominated the two size fractions at both sites along the oxygen gradient. Community composition at finer taxonomic levels was partially shaped by oxygen concentration, as communities associated with versus anoxic waters shared only ∼32\% of operational taxonomic unit ({OTU}) (97\% sequence identity) composition. Overall, only 9.7\% of total {OTUs} were recovered at both stations and under all oxygen conditions sampled, implying structuring of the eukaryotic community in this area. Size-fractionated communities exhibited different taxonomical features (e.g. Syndiniales Group I in the 1.6-30 μm fraction) that could be explained by the microniches created on the surface-originated sinking particles.},

Even after correction for lithogenic and ferruginous–scavenged metals, {ODZ} P-maxima are often enriched in Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn, exhibiting particulate trace metal ratios to P that exceed mixed layer biomass ratios by factors of 2–9. {ODZ} prokaryotic communities may be largely hidden, {TM}–rich pools involved in the marine cycles of these bioactive trace metals.},

The oil and gas seeps are typically overlain by chemosynthetic communities consisting of thiotrophic bacterial mats (Beggiatoa spp.) and methanotrophic mussels (Bathymodiolus spp.), respectively. Cores were recovered with a manned submersible from fine-grained sediments containing dispersed gas hydrates at the threshold of stability. Estimated sulfate reduction rates are variable but generally are substantially higher in crude oil seeps (up to 50 times) and methane seeps (up to 600 times) relative to a non-seep reference sediment (0.0043 μmol {SO}42− cm−3 day−1). Sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation factors are highest in the reference sediment (αS = 1.027; αO = 1.015) but substantially lower in the seep sediments (αS = 1.018 to 1.009; αO = 1.006 to 1.002) and are controlled primarily by kinetic factors related to sulfate reduction rates. Kinetic effects also control the δ34S/δ18O ratios such that slow microbial rates yield low ratios whereas faster rates yield progressively higher ratios. The seep data contradict previous claims that δ34S/δ18O ratios are diagnostic of either microbial sulfate reduction at a fixed δ34S/δ18O ratio of 4/1 or lower ratios caused by {SO}4–H2O equilibration at ambient temperatures. The new results offer a better understanding of methane removal via anaerobic oxidation in the sulfate reduction zone of hydrate-bearing sediments and have significant implications regarding the origin and geochemical history of sedimentary sulfate reconstructed on the basis of δ34S and δ18O compositions.},

The revised estimate of approx. 450 Tg N yr sup(-1) (Tg = 10 sup(12) g) produces an oceanic fixed N budget with a large deficit (approx. 200 Tg N yr sup(1)) that can be explained only by positing an ocean that has deviated far from a steady-state, the need for a major upwards revision of fixed N inputs, particularly nitrogen fixation, or both. Oceanic denitrification can be significantly altered by small re-distributions of carbon and dissolved oxygen. Since fixed N is a limiting nutrient, uncompensated changes in denitrification affect the ocean's ability to sequester atmospheric {CO} sub(2) via the "biological pump". Our concepts of the oceanic N sub(2) O regime to take better account of the extremely high N sub(2)O saturations that can arise in productive, low oxygen waters had to be modified. Recent results from the western Indian Shelf during a period when hypoxic, suboxic and anoxic waters were present produced a maximum surface N sub(2)O saturation of greater than 8000\%, a likely consequence of "stop and go" denitrification. The sensitivity of N sub(2) O production and consumption to small changes in the oceanic dissolved oxygen distribution and to the "spin-up" phase of denitrification suggests that the oceanic source term for N sub(2)O could change rapidly},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones are major sites of fixed nitrogen loss in the ocean. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, anammox, in pelagic nitrogen removal. Sources of ammonium for the anammox reaction, however, remain controversial, as heterotrophic denitrification and alternative anaerobic pathways of organic matter remineralization cannot account for the ammonium requirements of reported anammox rates. Here, we explore the significance of microaerobic respiration as a source of ammonium during organic matter degradation in the oxygen-deficient waters off Namibia and Peru. Experiments with additions of double-labelled oxygen revealed high aerobic activity in the upper {OMZs}, likely controlled by surface organic matter export. Consistently observed oxygen consumption in samples retrieved throughout the lower {OMZs} hints at efficient exploitation of vertically and laterally advected, oxygenated waters in this zone by aerobic microorganisms. In accordance, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses identified genes encoding for aerobic terminal oxidases and demonstrated their expression by diverse microbial communities, even in virtually anoxic waters. Our results suggest that microaerobic respiration is a major mode of organic matter remineralization and source of ammonium ({\textasciitilde}45-100\%) in the upper oxygen minimum zones, and reconcile hitherto observed mismatches between ammonium producing and consuming processes therein.},

	Aerobic bacteria and ocean circulation patterns control the formation and distribution of oxygen-minimum zones at moderate depth in the oceans. These habitats host microorganisms that thrive on other metabolic substrates in the absence of oxygen—most commonly, metabolizing thermodynamically favorable nitrogen compounds like nitrate. Off the coast of Chile, however, Canfield et al. (p. 1375, published online 11 November; see the Perspective by Teske) suggest that bacteria may often reduce sulfate as well. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of both sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. With the coincidence of sulfate and nitrate reduction, the sulfur and nitrogen cycles may be intimately linked; for example, sulfate reduction could provide nitrogen-rich ammonium for bacteria that ultimately transform it into nitrogen gas.
	Nitrogen cycling is normally thought to dominate the biogeochemistry and microbial ecology of oxygen-minimum zones in marine environments. Through a combination of molecular techniques and process rate measurements, we showed that both sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in oxygen-free waters off the coast of northern Chile. These processes may have been overlooked because in nature, the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction immediately oxidizes back to sulfate. This cryptic sulfur cycle is linked to anammox and other nitrogen cycling processes, suggesting that it may influence biogeochemical cycling in the global ocean.
	Bacterial sulfur reduction and oxidation accompanies nitrogen cycling where oxygen levels at depth are low.

However, the key carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (S) cycling processes catalyzed by {OMZ} microbial communities are poorly constrained spatially, temporally, and with regard to the different microbial groups involved. Here we sample across dissolved oxygen ({DO}) gradients in the oceans' largest {OMZ} by volume-the eastern tropical North Pacific ocean, or {ETNP}-and quantify 16S {rRNA} and functional gene transcripts to detect and constrain the activity of different S-cycling groups. Based on gene expression profiles, putative dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({dsrA}) genes are actively expressed within the {ETNP} {OMZ}. {dsrA} expression was limited almost entirely to samples with elevated nitrite concentrations, consistent with previous observations in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific {OMZ}. {dsrA} and 'reverse' dissimilatory sulfite reductase ({rdsrA}) genes are related and the associated enzymes are known to operate in either direction-reducing or oxidizing different S compounds. We found that {rdsrA} genes and {soxB} genes were expressed in the same samples, suggestive of active S cycling in the {ETNP} {OMZ}. These data provide potential thresholds for S cycling in {OMZs} that closely mimic recent predictions, and indicate that S cycling may be broadly relevant in {OMZs}.},

	abstract = {A major impediment to understanding long-term changes in the marine nitrogen (N) cycle is the persistent uncertainty about the rates, distribution, and sensitivity of its largest fluxes in the modern ocean. We use a global ocean circulation model to obtain the first 3-D estimate of marine denitrification rates that is maximally consistent with available observations of nitrate deficits and the nitrogen isotopic ratio of oceanic nitrate. We find a global rate of marine denitrification in suboxic waters and sediments of 120–240 Tg N yr−1, which is lower than many other recent estimates. The difference stems from the ability to represent the 3-D spatial structure of suboxic zones, where denitrification rates of 50–77 Tg N yr−1 result in up to 50\% depletion of nitrate. This depletion reduces the effect of local isotopic enrichment on the rest of the ocean, allowing the N isotope ratio of oceanic nitrate to be achieved with a sedimentary denitrification rate about 1.3–2.3 times that of suboxic zones. This balance of N losses between sediments and suboxic zones is shown to obey a simple relationship between isotope fractionation and the degree of nitrate consumption in the core of the suboxic zones. The global denitrification rates derived here suggest that the marine nitrogen budget is likely close to balanced.},

On the Washington State margin, where the water column is oxic, rain rates at 100 m were about 15 to 20 mmoles C m−2 d−1 and they decreased with increasing water depth to values of near 3 mmoles C m−2 d−1 at 1,000 m. The rain rate estimates, {CR}, were described by a power function, {CR} = {CR}100m(z/100)−α, with an attenuation coefficient, α, of 0.93 ({CR}100m = 16.2, r2 = 0.89). This attenuation rate is similar to numerous others previously reported for various oceanic areas. In contrast, off northwest Mexico, where the water column is oxygen deficient between 180 and 700 m, rain rates at 100 m were considerably less, about 7.5 mmoles C m−2 d−1, but rain rates at 1,000 m were similar to those off Washington. Thus, the attenuation coefficient for the Mexican margin was significantly lower, α = 0.36 ({CR}100m = 7.4, r2 = 0.77). Off Mexico, the rain rates estimated from sedimentary parameters were corroborated by values determined directly from sediment-trap deployments. The generally smaller rain rates off Mexico are probably due to the lower primary production, hence lower initial supply. The lower attenuation rate, however, is hypothesized to result from a decreased oxidation rate of the sinking flux within the oxygen-deficient zone relative to a more typical oxic water column.},

	abstract = {Today, over 90\% of all organic carbon burial in the ocean occurs in continental margin sediments. This burial is intrinsically linked to the cycling of biogeochemically important elements (such as N, P, S, Fe and Mn) and, on geological timescales, largely controls the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Currently there is a volatile debate over which processes govern sedimentary organic carbon preservation. In spite of numerous studies demonstrating empirical relationships between organic carbon burial and such factors as primary productivity, the flux of organic carbon through the water column, sedimentation rate,, organic carbon degradation rate, and bottom-water oxygen concentration,, the mechanisms directly controlling sedimentary organic carbon preservation remain unclear. Furthermore, as organic carbon burial is the process that, along with pyrite burial, balances O2 concentrations in the atmosphere, it is desirable that any mechanism proposed to control organic carbon preservation include a feedback buffering atmospheric oxygen concentrations over geological time. Here we compare analyses of sediments underlying two regions of the eastern North Pacific Ocean, one which has oxygen-depleted bottom waters and one with typical oxygen distributions. Organic carbon burial efficiency is strongly correlated with the length of time accumulating particles are exposed to molecular oxygen in sediment pore waters. Oxygen exposure time effectively incorporates other proposed environmental variables, and may exert a direct control on sedimentary organic carbon preservation and atmospheric oxygen concentrations.},

We combined rate measurements with metatranscriptomics to quantify {PA} and {FL} microbial activity in the oxygen minimum zone ({OMZ}) of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, focusing on dissimilatory processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle. Bacterial gene counts were 8- to 15-fold higher in the {FL} compared with the {PA} fraction. However, rates of all measured N cycle processes, excluding ammonia oxidation, declined significantly following particle ({\textgreater}1.6 μm) removal. Without particles, rates of nitrate reduction to nitrite (1.5–9.4nMNd−1) fell to zero and N2 production by denitrification (0.5–1.7nMNd−1) and anammox (0.3–1.9nMNd−1) declined by 53–85\%. The proportional representation of major microbial taxa and N cycle gene transcripts in metatranscriptomes followed fraction-specific trends. Transcripts encoding nitrate reductase were uniform among {PA} and {FL} fractions, whereas anammox-associated transcripts were proportionately enriched up to 15-fold in the {FL} fraction. In contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes for N2O and N2 production by denitrification were enriched up to 28-fold in {PA} samples. These patterns suggest that the majority of N cycle activity, excluding N2O and N2 production by denitrification, is confined to a {FL} majority that is critically dependent on access to particles, likely as a source of organic carbon and inorganic N. Variable particle distributions may drive heterogeneity in N cycle activity and gene expression in {OMZs}.},

Despite steep vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger predictor of community composition compared to depth.

Fraction-specific distributions were evident for key {OMZ} taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0.2-1.6 μm community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions, with the {\textgreater}1.6 μm community significantly enriched in genes mediating social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity. Prokaryotic transposase genes were three to six fold more abundant in this fraction, comprising up to 2\% of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that particle surfaces may act as hotbeds for transposition-based genome changes in marine microbes. Genes for nitric and nitrous oxide reduction were also more abundant (three to seven fold) in the larger size fraction, suggesting microniche partitioning of key denitrification steps.

Among these changes, warming, acidification, deoxygenation and changes in primary productivity by marine phytoplankton can be considered as four of the major stressors of open ocean ecosystems. Due to rising atmospheric {CO}2 in the coming decades, these changes will be amplified. Here, we use the most recent simulations performed in the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 to assess how these stressors may evolve over the course of the 21st century. The 10 Earth system models used here project similar trends in ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation and reduced primary productivity for each of the {IPCC}'s representative concentration pathways ({RCPs}) over the 21st century. For the "business-as-usual" scenario {RCP}8.5, the model-mean changes in the 2090s (compared to the 1990s) for sea surface temperature, sea surface {pH}, global O2 content and integrated primary productivity amount to +2.73 (±0.72) °C, −0.33 (±0.003) {pH} unit, −3.45 (±0.44)\% and −8.6 (±7.9)\%, respectively. For the high mitigation scenario {RCP}2.6, corresponding changes are +0.71 (±0.45) °C, −0.07 (±0.001) {pH} unit, −1.81 (±0.31)\% and −2.0 (±4.1)\%, respectively, illustrating the effectiveness of extreme mitigation strategies. Although these stressors operate globally, they display distinct regional patterns and thus do not change coincidentally. Large decreases in O2 and in {pH} are simulated in global ocean intermediate and mode waters, whereas large reductions in primary production are simulated in the tropics and in the North Atlantic. Although temperature and {pH} projections are robust across models, the same does not hold for projections of subsurface O2 concentrations in the tropics and global and regional changes in net primary productivity. These high uncertainties in projections of primary productivity and subsurface oxygen prompt us to continue inter-model comparisons to understand these model differences, while calling for caution when using the {CMIP}5 models to force regional impact models.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are the most abundant lifeform on Earth, mediating global fluxes of matter and energy. Over the past decade, high-throughput molecular techniques generating multiomic sequence information ({DNA}, {mRNA}, and protein) have transformed our perception of this microcosmos, conceptually linking microorganisms at the individual, population, and community levels to a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. Here, we develop a biogeochemical model that describes metabolic coupling along the redox gradient in Saanich Inlet—a seasonally anoxic fjord with biogeochemistry analogous to oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}). The model reproduces measured biogeochemical process rates as well as {DNA}, {mRNA}, and protein concentration profiles across the redox gradient. Simulations make predictions about the role of ubiquitous {OMZ} microorganisms in mediating carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. For example, nitrite “leakage” during incomplete sulfide-driven denitrification by {SUP}05 Gammaproteobacteria is predicted to support inorganic carbon fixation and intense nitrogen loss via anaerobic ammonium oxidation. This coupling creates a metabolic niche for nitrous oxide reduction that completes denitrification by currently unidentified community members. These results quantitatively improve previous conceptual models describing microbial metabolic networks in {OMZs}. Beyond {OMZ}-specific predictions, model results indicate that geochemical fluxes are robust indicators of microbial community structure and reciprocally, that gene abundances and geochemical conditions largely determine gene expression patterns. The integration of real observational data, including geochemical profiles and process rate measurements as well as metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic sequence data, into a biogeochemical model, as shown here, enables holistic insight into the microbial metabolic network driving nutrient and energy flow at ecosystem scales.},

	abstract = {Dissolved oxygen in the mid-depth tropical Pacific Ocean has declined in the past several decades. The resulting expansion of the oxygen minimum zone has consequences for the region’s ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, but the causes of the oxygen decline are not yet fully understood. Here we combine models of atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling to test the hypothesis that atmospheric pollution over the Pacific Ocean contributed to the redistribution of oxygen in deeper waters. We simulate the pollution-induced enhancement of atmospheric soluble iron and fixed nitrogen deposition, as well as its impacts on ocean productivity and biogeochemical cycling for the late twentieth century. The model reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen changes from the 1970s to the 1990s, and the sensitivity experiments reveal the reinforcing effects of pollution-enhanced iron deposition and natural climate variability. Despite the aerosol deposition being the largest in mid-latitudes, its effect on oceanic oxygen is most pronounced in the tropics, where ocean circulation transports added iron to the tropics, leading to an increased regional productivity, respiration and subsurface oxygen depletion. These results suggest that anthropogenic pollution can interact and amplify climate-driven impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, even in remote ocean biomes.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones ({OMZs}) harbor unique microbial communities that rely on alternative electron acceptors for respiration. Conditions therein enable an almost complete nitrogen (N) cycle and substantial N-loss. N-loss in {OMZs} is attributable to anammox and heterotrophic denitrification, whereas nitrate reduction to nitrite along with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium are major remineralization pathways. Despite virtually anoxic conditions, nitrification also occurs in {OMZs}, converting remineralized ammonium to N-oxides. The concurrence of all these processes provides a direct channel from organic N to the ultimate N-loss, whereas most individual processes are likely controlled by organic matter. Many microorganisms inhabiting the {OMZs} are capable of multiple functions in the N- and other elemental cycles. Their versatile metabolic potentials versus actual activities present a challenge to ecophysiological and biogeochemical measurements. These challenges need to be tackled before we can realistically predict how N-cycling in {OMZs}, and thus oceanic N-balance, will respond to future global perturbations.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd), a trace nutrient for marine algae, has a marine distribution that closely matches the macronutrients nitrate and phosphate. Sedimentary microfossil records of Cd provide reconstructions of past ocean nutrient distributions that facilitate understanding the role of the oceans in the carbon cycle and climate change. However, incomplete knowledge of processes that control the addition and removal of Cd in the ocean, and Cd’s variability relative to major nutrients, limit use of the paleoceanographic proxy. We present coupled data of Cd concentration and isotopic composition in seawater and suspended marine particles, indicating direct removal of Cd via coprecipitation with sulfide in oxygen-deficient waters. Thus, the marine Cd cycle may be highly sensitive to the extent of global oceanic oxygen depletion., Cadmium (Cd) is a micronutrient and a tracer of biological productivity and circulation in the ocean. The correlation between dissolved Cd and the major algal nutrients in seawater has led to the use of Cd preserved in microfossils to constrain past ocean nutrient distributions. However, linking Cd to marine biological processes requires constraints on marine sources and sinks of Cd. Here, we show a decoupling between Cd and major nutrients within oxygen-deficient zones ({ODZs}) in both the Northeast Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, which we attribute to Cd sulfide ({CdS}) precipitation in euxinic microenvironments around sinking biological particles. We find that dissolved Cd correlates well with dissolved phosphate in oxygenated waters, but is depleted compared with phosphate in {ODZs}. Additionally, suspended particles from the North Atlantic show high Cd content and light Cd stable isotope ratios within the {ODZ}, indicative of {CdS} precipitation. Globally, we calculate that {CdS} precipitation in {ODZs} is an important, and to our knowledge a previously undocumented marine sink of Cd. Our results suggest that water column oxygen depletion has a substantial impact on Cd biogeochemical cycling, impacting the global relationship between Cd and major nutrients and suggesting that Cd may be a previously unidentified tracer for water column oxygen deficiency on geological timescales. Similar depletions of copper and zinc in the Northeast Pacific indicate that sulfide precipitation in {ODZs} may also have an influence on the global distribution of other trace metals.},

Whether it also determines carbon burial rates remains controversial. We investigated the effect of varying oxygen concentrations (170 to 0 μM O2) on microbial remineralization of organic matter in seafloor sediments and on community diversity of the northwestern Crimean shelf break. This study shows that 50\% more organic matter is preserved in surface sediments exposed to hypoxia compared to oxic bottom waters. Hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decreased remineralization rates even within short periods of a few days. These conditions led to the accumulation of threefold more phytodetritus pigments within 40 years compared to the oxic zone. Bacterial community structure also differed between oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic zones. Functional groups relevant in the degradation of particulate organic matter, such as Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, changed with decreasing oxygenation, and the microbial community of the hypoxic zone took longer to degrade similar amounts of deposited reactive matter. We conclude that hypoxic bottom-water conditions—even on short time scales—substantially increase the preservation potential of organic matter because of the negative effects on benthic fauna and particle mixing and by favoring anaerobic processes, including sulfurization of matter.
	Hypoxia enhances organic matter preservation in marine sediments by changing benthic communities, bioturbation, and burial rates.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Amazon River runs nearly 6500 km across the South American continent before emptying into the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean. In terms of both volume and watershed area, it is the world's largest riverine system, affecting elemental cycling on a global scale.
	{RESULTS}: A quantitative inventory of genes and transcripts benchmarked with internal standards was obtained at five stations in the lower Amazon River during May 2011. At each station, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were obtained in duplicate for two microbial size fractions (free-living, 0.2 to 2.0 μm; particle-associated, 2.0 to 297 μm) using 150 × 150 paired-end Illumina sequencing. Forty eight sample datasets were obtained, averaging 15 × 10(6) potential protein-encoding reads each (730 × 10(6) total). Prokaryotic metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Betaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospirae, and Acidobacteria. The actinobacterium {SCGC} {AAA}027-L06 reference genome recruited the greatest number of reads overall, with this single bin contributing an average of 50 billion genes and 500 million transcripts per liter of river water. Several dominant taxa were unevenly distributed between the free-living and particle-associated size fractions, such as a particle-associated bias for reads binning to planctomycete Schlesneria paludicola and a free-living bias for actinobacterium {SCGC} {AAA}027-L06. Gene expression ratios (transcripts to gene copy ratio) increased downstream from Óbidos to Macapá and Belém, indicating higher per cell activity of Amazon River bacteria and archaea as river water approached the ocean.
	{CONCLUSION}: This inventory of riverine microbial genes and transcripts, benchmarked with internal standards for full quantitation, provides an unparalleled window into microbial taxa and functions in the globally important Amazon River ecosystem.},

Microbes in rivers perform essential ecosystem roles including the mineralization of significant quantities of organic matter originating from terrestrial habitats.

Here we present the first metagenomic study on the microbiota of this river. It presents many features in common with the other freshwater metagenome available (Lake Gatun in Panama) and much less similarity with marine samples. Among the microbial taxa found, the cosmopolitan freshwater {acI} lineage of the actinobacteria was clearly dominant. Group I Crenarchaea and the freshwater sister group of the marine {SAR}11 clade, {LD}12, were found alongside more exclusive and well known freshwater taxa such as Polynucleobacter. A metabolism-centric analysis revealed a disproportionate representation of pathways involved in heterotrophic carbon processing, as compared to those found in marine samples. In particular, these river microbes appear to be specialized in taking up and mineralizing allochthonous carbon derived from plant material.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns in microbial biodiversity across the Amazon river-ocean continuum were investigated along ∼675 km of the lower Amazon River mainstem, in the Tapajós River tributary, and in the plume and coastal ocean during low and high river discharge using amplicon sequencing of 16S {rRNA} genes in whole water and size-fractionated samples (0.2-2.0 μm and {\textgreater}2.0 μm). River communities varied among tributaries, but mainstem communities were spatially homogeneous and tracked seasonal changes in river discharge and co-varying factors. Co-occurrence network analysis identified strongly interconnected river assemblages during high (May) and low (December) discharge periods, and weakly interconnected transitional assemblages in September, suggesting that this system supports two seasonal microbial communities linked to river discharge. In contrast, plume communities showed little seasonal differences and instead varied spatially tracking salinity. However, salinity explained only a small fraction of community variability, and plume communities in blooms of diatom-diazotroph assemblages were strikingly different than those in other high salinity plume samples. This suggests that while salinity physically structures plumes through buoyancy and mixing, the composition of plume-specific communities is controlled by other factors including nutrients, phytoplankton community composition, and dissolved organic matter chemistry. Co-occurrence networks identified interconnected assemblages associated with the highly productive low salinity near-shore region, diatom-diazotroph blooms, and the plume edge region, and weakly interconnected assemblages in high salinity regions. This suggests that the plume supports a transitional community influenced by immigration of ocean bacteria from the plume edge, and by species sorting as these communities adapt to local environmental conditions. Few studies have explored patterns of microbial diversity in tropical rivers and coastal oceans. Comparison of Amazon continuum microbial communities to those from temperate and arctic systems suggest that river discharge and salinity are master variables structuring a range of environmental conditions that control bacterial communities across the river-ocean continuum.},

	abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth’s surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

	abstract = {What will control future rates of climate change? The carbon cycle is the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change, yet despite decades of research (1), significant mysteries about its behavior remain. Global analyses show that the Earth system absorbs approximately half of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. This uptake is partitioned between absorption by the oceans and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Uptake by the Earth system reduces the climate effects of emitted {CO}2 to approximately half of what would occur without sinks. Models tend to project sinks, particularly terrestrial sinks, into the future based on assumptions about the behavior of mechanisms derived from small plot or laboratory studies.
	
	The observational record is now long enough and rich enough to provide strong constraints on both the human and the biogeochemical behavior of the carbon cycle. In this issue of {PNAS}, Canadell et al. (2) report an increase in the rate of increase in {CO}2 in the atmosphere (henceforth called the “growth rate”). They analyze the historical carbon record and industrial and biogeochemical causes to changes in its behavior over time. Industrial growth is responsible for ≈65\% of the change in the growth rate, 17\% is caused by increasing carbon intensity (fossil fuel use/gross world product), and 18\% is caused by reduced sinks in the Earth system. The reduction over time of the efficiency of the sinks is of great concern because it implies a weakening in the ability of the Earth system to mitigate the effects of fossil fuel emissions and a potential positive feedback that may strengthen in the future.
	
	A progressive weakening of Earth system sinks has long been of concern (3), but until recently, insufficient information has existed to diagnose the behavior of the carbon sinks over time. The fraction of fossil fuel-derived {CO}2 remaining in …

	abstract = {The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2), the largest human contributor to human-induced climate change, is increasing rapidly. Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel {CO}2 emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000–2006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3\% to 3.3\% y−1. The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction ({AF}) of {CO}2 emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of {CO}2 sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric {CO}2 growth rate have been ≈65 ± 16\% from increasing global economic activity, 17 ± 6\% from the increasing carbon intensity of the global economy, and 18 ± 15\% from the increase in {AF}. An increasing {AF} is consistent with results of climate–carbon cycle models, but the magnitude of the observed signal appears larger than that estimated by models. All of these changes characterize a carbon cycle that is generating stronger-than-expected and sooner-than-expected climate forcing.},

Most potential controls on community composition also exhibited synchrony; these included bacterial production rate (leucine incorporation), water temperature, river flow rate, and a suite of chemical measurements. Temperature and river flow rate were the best predictors of temporal patterns in diversity. However, diversity patterns also correlated with bacterial production and concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate, suggesting that diversity is directly or indirectly influenced by complex seasonal shifts in environmental conditions. Winter and summer communities were somewhat predictable over 3 yr, although these communities were not identical. Two polymerase chain reaction ({PCR})-amplified clone libraries of 16S {rDNA}, constructed with summer samples from each river, were not significantly different and contained typical freshwater bacterioplankton of the beta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, including members of five new freshwater bacterioplankton clusters.

In this study, machine learning was used to develop discharge prediction models trained on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa classified into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) based on 16S {rRNA} gene sequences from six large arctic rivers. We term this approach “genohydrology,” and show that {OTU} relative abundances can be used to predict river discharge at monthly and longer timescales. Based on a single {DNA} sample from each river, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}) for predicted mean monthly discharge values throughout the year was 0.84, while the {NSE} for predicted discharge values across different return intervals was 0.67. These are considerable improvements over predictions based only on the area-scaled mean specific discharge of five similar rivers, which had average {NSE} values of 0.64 and −0.32 for seasonal and recurrence interval discharge values, respectively. The genohydrology approach demonstrates that genetic diversity within the aquatic microbiome is a large and underutilized data resource with benefits for prediction of hydrologic function.},

The Amazon River exports large amounts of {DOM}, and yet the fate of this material in the ocean remains unclear. Here we investigate the molecular composition and transformations of {DOM} in the Amazon River-ocean continuum using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical and biological tracers. We show that there is a strong gradient in source and composition of {DOM} along the continuum, and that dilution of riverine {DOM} in the ocean is the dominant pattern of variability in the system. Alterations in {DOM} composition are observed in the plume associated with the addition of new organic compounds by phytoplankton and with bacterial and photochemical transformations. The relative importance of each of these drivers varies spatially and is modulated by seasonal variations in river discharge and ocean circulation. We further show that a large fraction (50–76\%) of the Amazon River {DOM} is surprisingly stable in the coastal ocean. This results in a globally significant river plume with a strong terrigenous signature and in substantial export of terrestrially derived organic carbon from the continental margin, where it can be entrained in the large-scale circulation and potentially contribute to the long-term storage of terrigenous production and to the recalcitrant carbon pool found in the deep ocean.},

Whereas global estimates of atmospheric {CO}2 exchange indicate that the tropics are near equilibrium or are a source with respect to carbon1,2, ground-based estimates indicate that the amount of carbon that is being absorbed by mature rainforests is similar to or greater than that being released by tropical deforestation3,4 (about 1.6 Gt C yr-1). Estimates of the magnitude of carbon sequestration are uncertain, however, depending on whether they are derived from measurements of gas fluxes above forests5,6 or of biomass accumulation in vegetation and soils3,7. It is also possible that methodological errors may overestimate rates of carbon uptake or that other loss processes have yet to be identified3. Here we demonstrate that outgassing (evasion) of {CO}2 from rivers and wetlands of the central Amazon basin constitutes an important carbon loss process, equal to 1.2 ± 0.3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. This carbon probably originates from organic matter transported from upland and flooded forests, which is then respired and outgassed downstream. Extrapolated across the entire basin, this flux—at 0.5 Gt C yr-1—is an order of magnitude greater than fluvial export of organic carbon to the ocean8. From these findings, we suggest that the overall carbon budget of rainforests, summed across terrestrial and aquatic environments, appears closer to being in balance than would be inferred from studies of uplands alone3,5,6.},

	abstract = {A large fraction of the organic carbon derived from land that is transported through inland waters is decomposed along river systems and emitted to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide ({CO}2). The Amazon River outgasses nearly as much {CO}2 as the rainforest sequesters on an annual basis, representing {\textasciitilde}25\% of global {CO}2 emissions from inland waters. However, current estimates of {CO}2 outgassing from the Amazon basin are based on a conservative upscaling of measurements made in the central Amazon, meaning both basin and global scale budgets are likely underestimated. The lower Amazon River, from Óbidos to the river mouth, represents {\textasciitilde}13\% of the total drainage basin area, and is not included in current basin-scale estimates. Here, we assessed the concentration and evasion rate of {CO}2 along the lower Amazon River corridor and its major tributaries, the Tapajós and Xingu Rivers. Evasive {CO}2 fluxes were directly measured using floating chambers and gas transfer coefficients (k600) were calculated for different hydrological seasons. Temporal variations in {pCO}2 and {CO}2 emissions were similar to previous observations throughout the Amazon (e.g. peak concentrations at high water) and {CO}2 outgassing was lower in the clearwater tributaries compared to the mainstem. However, k600 values were higher than previously reported upstream likely due to the generally windier conditions, turbulence caused by tidal forces, and an amplification of these factors in the wider channels with a longer fetch. We estimate that the lower Amazon River mainstem emits 0.2 Pg C yr-1 within our study boundaries, or as much as 0.48 Pg C yr-1 if the entire spatial extent to the geographical mouth is considered. Including these values with updated basin scale estimates and estimates of {CO}2 outgassing from small streams we estimate that the Amazon running waters outgasses as much as 1.39 Pg C yr-1, increasing the global emissions from inland waters by 43\% for a total of 2.9 Pg C yr-1. These results highlight a large missing gap in basin-scale carbon budgets along the complete continuum of the Amazon River, and likely most other large river systems, that could drastically alter global scale carbon budgets.},

Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at Óbidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized {DOM} via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ({FT}-{ICR}-{MS}), determined {DOM} stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the {DOM} molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous {DOM}. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed 13C-depleted and 13C-enriched terrigenous {DOM}, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive {DOM} had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous {DOM} therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine {DOM} compounds became relatively enriched, bulk {DOC} concentrations were 9 to 30\% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous {DOM} was not compensated by marine {DOM} production. We propose that removal of terrigenous {DOM} in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal {DOM}, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down {DOM} into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of {DOM} to sinking particles.},

Three mainstem stations spanning a 625 km reach had similar gene expression patterns (transcripts gene copy-1) across a diverse suite of element cycling genes, but two tributary-influenced stations at the mouth of the Tapajós River and near the Tocantins River at Belém had distinct transcriptome composition and expression ratios, particularly for genes encoding light-related energy capture (higher) and iron acquisition and ammonia oxidation (lower). Environmental parameters that were useful predictors of gene expression ratios included concentrations of lignin phenols, suspended sediments, nitrate, phosphate, and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen. Similar to the gene expression data, these chemical properties reflected highly homogeneous mainstem stations punctuated by distinct tributary-influenced stations at Tapajós and Belém. Although heterotrophic processes were expected to dominate in the lower Amazon, transcripts from photosynthetic bacteria were abundant in tributary-influenced regions, and transcripts from Thaumarcheota taxa genetically capable of chemosynthetic ammonia oxidation accounted for up to 21\% of the transcriptome at others. Based on regressions of transcript numbers against gene numbers, expression ratios of Thaumarchaeota populations were largely unchanged within the mainstem, suggesting a relatively minor role for gene regulation. These quantitative gene and transcript inventories detail a diverse array of energy acquisition strategies and metabolic capabilities for bacteria and archaea populations of the world’s largest river system.},

	abstract = {The Amazon River watershed and its associated plume comprise a vast continental and oceanic area. The microbial activities along this continuum contribute substantially to global carbon and nutrient cycling, and yet there is a dearth of information on the diversity, abundance, and possible roles of viruses in this globally important river. The aim of this study was to elucidate the diversity and structure of virus assemblages of the Amazon River-ocean continuum. Environmental viral {DNA} sequences were obtained for 12 locations along the river’s lower reach (n = 5) and plume (n = 7). Sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes. Despite the spatial connectivity mediated by the river, virome analyses and physical-chemical water parameters clearly distinguished river and plume ecosystems. Bacteriophages were ubiquitous in the continuum and were more abundant in the transition region. Eukaryotic viruses occurred mostly in the river, while the plume had more viruses of autotrophic organisms (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) and heterotrophic bacteria (Pelagibacter). The viral families Microviridae and Myoviridae were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. The major functions of the genes in the continuum involved viral structures and life cycles, and viruses from plume locations and Tapajós River showed the highest levels of functional diversity. The distribution patterns of the viral assemblages were defined not only by the occurrence of possible hosts but also by water physical and chemical parameters, especially salinity. The findings presented here help to improve understanding of the possible roles of viruses in the organic matter cycle along the river-ocean continuum.
	{IMPORTANCE} The Amazon River forms a vast plume in the Atlantic Ocean that can extend for more than 1,000 km. Microbial communities promote a globally relevant carbon sink system in the plume. Despite the importance of viruses for the global carbon cycle, the diversity and the possible roles of viruses in the Amazon are poorly understood. The present work assesses, for the first time, the abundance and diversity of viruses simultaneously in the river and ocean in order to elucidate their possible roles. {DNA} sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes from the 12 river and ocean locations. Viral diversity was clearly distinguished by river and ocean. Bacteriophages were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. Viruses that infect eukaryotes were more abundant in the river, whereas phages appeared to have strong control over the host prokaryotic populations in the plume.},

	abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

	abstract = {River systems play a pivotal role in transporting and transforming organic carbon ({OC}) fixed by terrestrial primary production. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the connectivity of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine carbon budgets due to a lack of measurements along the lower (i.e. tidally-influenced) reaches of large river systems. For example, all estimates of carbon fluxes from the world's largest river, the Amazon, are based on measurements made at and upstream of Óbidos, roughly 900km from the mouth. Here we examine the evolution of {OC} concentrations and composition from Óbidos to two discreet channels near the mouth of the Amazon River during five cruises from 2010 to 2012. {OC} characteristics of the Tapajós River, which enters the Amazon River downstream of Óbidos, and the Tocantins River, which mixes with the Amazon River plume in the Atlantic Ocean, were also assessed. The average concentration of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) across the two main channels near the mouth was 0.6±0.3mgL−1 during the study period, decreasing from 1.2±1.0mgL−1 at Óbidos. Average dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) concentrations, on the other hand, increased from 3.9±0.6mgL−1 at Óbidos to 4.2±0.9mgL−1 across the mouth. The discharge of total {OC} to the ocean was composed of 89±3\% dissolved load, compared to 76±13\% at Óbidos. Measurements of bulk {OC} stable isotopic signatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and lignin phenol abundance were used to assess unique {OC} sources along the continuum. For example, the stable isotopic composition of {POC} and {DOC} indicated a replacement of highland forest-derived {OC} with lowland and floodplain-derived {OC} from Óbidos to the mouth. Likewise, lignin phenol signatures showed an increase in the degradation state of vascular plant-derived {OC} from Óbidos to the mouth. Results from this study illustrate that the abundance and composition of {OC} continue to evolve along the lower reaches of large tropical rivers, which has significant implications on estimations of geochemical fluxes to the ocean.},

Dark incubation experiments were performed at high and low water periods using vanillin, a lignin phenol derived from vascular plants, and at the high water period using four different 13C-labeled plant litter leachates. Leachates derived from oak wood were degraded most slowly with vanillin monomers, macrophyte leaves, macrophyte stems, and whole grass leachates being converted to {CO}2 1.2, 1.3, 1.7, and 2.3 times faster, respectively, at the upstream boundary, Óbidos. Relative to Óbidos, the sum degradation rate of all four leachates was 3.3 and 2.6 times faster in the algae-rich Tapajós and Xingu Rivers, respectively. Likewise, the leachates were broken down 3.2 times more quickly at Óbidos when algal biomass from the Tapajós River was simultaneously added. Leachate reactivity similarly increased from Óbidos to the mouth with leachates breaking down 1.7 times more quickly at Almeirim (midway to the mouth) and 2.8 times more quickly across the river mouth. There was no discernible correlation between in situ nutrient levels and remineralization rates, suggesting that priming effects were an important factor controlling reactivity along the continuum. Further, continuous measurements of {CO}2, O2, and conductivity along the confluence of the Tapajós and Amazon Rivers and the Xingu and Jarauçu Rivers revealed in situ evidence for enhanced O2 drawdown and {CO}2 production along the mixing zone of these confluences.},

Increasing evidence for the importance of picoplankton, bacteria and viruses as {POM} constituents is highlighted, including the recent recognition of large populations of autotrophic bacteria able to harvest light for energy. The transport of {POM} to bottom waters was thought to be largely confined to large, rapidly sinking faecal pellets. However, recent studies have highlighted the importance of organic aggregates and flocs formed by diatoms such as Rhizosolenia and other microalgae. Ascending particles have also been discovered, many of which are lipid-rich. Several studies have shown that resuspension of bottom sediments and lateral advection of material from continental shelves can lead to anomalously high particle fluxes measured in sediment traps moored in deep water. Many new approaches for characterizing {POM} have emerged, such as pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry for analysis of higher molecular weight materials and biopolymers. Lipid biomarker techniques have also advanced, exciting new possibilities being raised by the ability to measure stable and radioactive carbon isotopes for individual compounds. The techniques of molecular biology, such as the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), are being increasingly applied to provide complementary information to more conventional microscopy and flow cytometry on the identity of organisms in the sea. The combination of these techniques with advanced chemical analysis methods promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the origins, transport and fate of organic matter in the oceans.},

	abstract = {The sources and burial processes of organic matter in marine sediments are not well understood, yet they are important if we are to have a better understanding of the global carbon cycle. In particular, the nature and fraction of the terrestrial organic carbon preserved in marine sediments is poorly constrained. Here we use the chemical and stable carbon isotope signatures of oxidation products from a macromolecular component (lignin) of the terrigenous organic matter preserved in offshore surface sediments in the Gulf of Mexico to complement similar data from an existing onshore transect in this region. The complete onshore–offshore data set, along with radiocarbon dates of the bulk organic material at the same sites, allows the differentiation of material originating from plants that photosynthesize using the C4 mechanism from those that undergo C3 photosynthesis. We conclude that the offshore lignins derive from erosion of the extensive grassland (C4) soils of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and that the nearshore lignins originate largely from C3 plant detritus from coastal forests and swamps. This distribution is probably due to the hydrodynamic sorting of the different source materials during their seaward transport. These results suggest that previous studies have significantly underestimated the terrigenous fraction of organic matter in offshore sediments by not recognizing the contribution of C4 vegetation to the carbon-isotope composition. Such an underestimate may force revisions in the assessment of past marine primary productivity and associated organic carbon fluxes, and of organic matter preservation/remineralization and nutrient cycling in marine sediments.},

Inorganic nitrogen concentrations are consequently very low in surface waters of temperate ocean gyres, yet fixed nitrogen persists in the form of dissolved organic matter. The small, rapidly cycling organic compounds fundamental to microbial and planktonic growth (such as free amino acids, amines and urea) account for only a minor fraction of total dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}). In contrast, the vast majority of {DON}, especially in the deep ocean, resides in the form of nitrogenous substances that are resistant to biological degradation. These substances, which represent an enormous reservoir of fixed nitrogen, are not readily identified by conventional biochemical techniques, but have been assumed to consist largely of structurally complex macromolecules resulting from the degradation and spontaneous abiotic condensation of biochemical precursors. Here we present 15N {NMR} measurements that contradict this view. Our results show that most higher-molecular-weight {DON} in the ocean exists in amide form, rather than as a collection of nitrogen heterocycles that might be indicative of spontaneous condensation products. Because these amides are unlikely to form abiotically, the bulk of the ocean's {DON} reservoir appears to derive directly from degradation-resistant biomolecules.},

We know very little about geographical variability in the remineralization depth of this sinking material and less about what controls such variability. Here we present previously unpublished profiles of mesopelagic {POC} flux derived from neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed in the North Atlantic, from which we calculate the remineralization length scale for each site. Combining these results with corresponding data from the North Pacific, we show that the observed variability in attenuation of vertical {POC} flux can largely be explained by temperature, with shallower remineralization occurring in warmer waters. This is seemingly inconsistent with conclusions drawn from earlier analyses of deep-sea sediment trap and export flux data, which suggest lowest transfer efficiency at high latitudes. However, the two patterns can be reconciled by considering relatively intense remineralization of a labile fraction of material in warm waters, followed by efficient downward transfer of the remaining refractory fraction, while in cold environments, a larger labile fraction undergoes slower remineralization that continues over a longer length scale. Based on the observed relationship, future increases in ocean temperature will likely lead to shallower remineralization of {POC} and hence reduced storage of {CO}2 by the ocean.},

Free-living cells live in a dilute and complex substrate field, and to gain enough substrate, their extracellular enzymes must be utilized efficiently. The model revealed that surface-attached and free enzymes generate unique enzyme and substrate fields, and each deployment strategy has distinctive advantages. For a solitary cell, surface-attached enzymes are suggested to be the most cost-efficient strategy. This strategy entails potential substrates being reduced to very low concentrations. Free enzymes, on the other hand, generate a radically different substrate field, which suggests significant benefits for the strategy if free cells engage in social foraging or experience high substrate concentrations. Swimming has a slight positive effect for the attached-enzyme strategy, while the effect is negative for the free-enzyme strategy. The results of this study suggest that specific dissolved organic compounds in the ocean likely persist below a threshold concentration impervious to biological utilization. This could help explain the persistence and apparent refractory state of oceanic dissolved organic matter ({DOM}). Microbial extracellular enzyme strategies, therefore, have important implications for larger-scale processes, such as shaping the role of {DOM} in ocean carbon sequestration.},

In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring ∼6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

	Protists are single-celled organisms complete with nuclei, organelles, and symbionts, and possess a multiplicity of physiological talents. They are ubiquitous, abundant, and often neglected by science. Worden et al. review the challenges of understanding the role protists play in geochemical cycling in the oceans. These organisms can photosynthesize like plants, graze on bacteria and archaea, parasitize each other and bigger creatures, have sex, and sometimes do all these things serially as conditions change. Their activities may have a significant influence on carbon cycling, and research efforts need to be amplified to understand their functional importance in marine ecosystems.
	Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1257594
	Structured Abstract
	{BACKGROUND} Marine ecosystems are composed of a diverse array of life forms, the majority of which are unicellular—archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. The power of these microbes to process carbon, shape Earth’s atmosphere, and fuel marine food webs has been established over the past 40 years. The marine biosphere is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, rivaling that of land plants. Unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are major contributors to this ocean productivity. In addition to photosynthetic growth, protists exhibit a range of other trophic modes, including predation, mixotrophy (a combination of photosynthetic and predatory-based nutrition), parasitism, symbiosis, osmotrophy, and saprotrophy (wherein extracellular enzymes break down organic matter to smaller compounds that are then transported into the cell by osmotrophy).
	{ADVANCES} Sensitive field approaches have illuminated the enormous diversity of protistan life (much of it uncultured) and, coupled with activity measurements, are leading to hypotheses about their ecological roles. In parallel, large-scale sequencing projects are providing fundamental advances in knowledge of genome/gene composition, especially among photosynthetic lineages, many of which are complex amalgams derived from multiple endosymbiotic mergers. Marine protists have yielded insight into basic biology, evolution, and molecular machineries that control organismal responses to the environment. These studies reveal tightly controlled signaling and transcriptional regulation as well as responses to limitation of resources such as iron, nitrogen, and vitamins, and offer understanding of animal and plant evolution. With the formulation of better computational approaches, hypotheses about interactions and trophic exchanges are becoming more exact and modelers more assertive at integrating different data types. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are being reported in multiple systems, of which polar environments are the touchstone of change.
	{OUTLOOK} Driven by the need to translate the biology of cells into processes at global scales, researchers must bring the conceptual framework of systems biology into bigger “ecosystems biology” models that broadly capture the geochemical activities of interacting plankton networks. Existing data show that protists are major components of marine food webs, but deducing and quantifying their ecosystem linkages and the resulting influences on carbon cycling is difficult. Genome-based functional predictions are complicated by the importance of cellular structures and flexible behaviors in protists, which are inherently more difficult to infer than the biochemical pathways typically studied in prokaryotes. Alongside the plethora of genes of unknown function, manipulable genetic systems are rare for marine protists. The development of genetic systems and gene editing for diverse, ecologically important lineages, as well as innovative tools for preserving microbe-microbe interactions during sampling, for visual observation, and for quantifying biogeochemical transformations, are critical but attainable goals. These must be implemented in both field work and laboratory physiology studies that examine multiple environmental factors. Expanding genome functional predictions to identify the molecular underpinnings of protistan trophic modes and realistically constrain metabolism will position the field to build reliable cell systems biology models and link these to field studies. By factoring in true complexities, we can capture key elements of protistan interactions for assimilation into more predictive global carbon cycle models. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6223/1257594/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Global biogeochemical and ecological models rely on understanding organismal biology and the interactions occurring in marine microbial food webs. Protists have multifarious roles from the sunlit surface ocean to leagues below. Understanding of protistan behaviors and adaptability lags far behind knowledge of evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomes. As such, microbial mediation of carbon fluxes and specific interactions remain ill-resolved and predictive capabilities are still weak. Strategies to narrow this gap involve iteration between experimental and observational field studies, controlled laboratory experiments, systems biology approaches that preserve cellular structures and behaviors using relevant model taxa, and computational approaches.
	The profound influence of marine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires—a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences. We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.},

Together these one hundred plus biochemicals account for 80\% of the total organic carbon (C org) in net-plankton and particles sinking from the euphotic zone, but represent only 24 and 20\% of the organic carbon in deep-water particles and surface sediments, respectively. Scaled profiles of relative abundances, clearly illustrate (a) exponential losses of plankton remains and increases in heterotroph biomarkers throughout the water column, (b) elevated proportions of bacterial markers near the sediment surface, and (c) preservation of selected remains of bacteria, phytoplankton and vascular land plants deeper in the sediments. In spite of one of the most comprehensive analyses of major biochemicals yet applied to marine particulate samples, percentages of molecularly uncharacterized organic carbon increase progressively down the water column to values near 80\% in the underlying sediments.

The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

We investigated the patterns of light-induced particle breakdown and bacterial assimilation of detrital C and N using 13C and 15N labeled freeze-thawed diatom cells incubated in laboratory microcosms with a marine microbial community freshly-collected from the Pacific Ocean. Particles incubated in the dark resulted in increased bacterial counts and dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to those incubated in the light. Light also influenced the attached and free-living microbial community structure as detected by 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing. For example, bacterial taxa from the Sphingobacteriia were enriched on dark-incubated particles and taxa from the family Flavobacteriaceae and the genus Pseudoalteromonas were numerically enriched on particles in the light. Isotope incorporation analysis by phylogenetic microarray and {NanoSIMS} (a method called Chip-{SIP}) identified free-living and attached microbial taxa able to incorporate N and C from the particles. Some taxa, including members of the Flavobacteriaceae and Cryomorphaceae, exhibited increased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting the use of photoheterotrophic metabolisms. In contrast, some members of Oceanospirillales and Rhodospirillales showed decreased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting that their heterotrophic metabolism, particularly when occurring on particles, might increase at night or may be inhibited by sunlight. These results show that light influences particle degradation and C and N incorporation by attached bacteria, suggesting that the transfer between particulate and free-living phases are likely affected by external factors that change with the light regime, such as time of day, depth and season.},

	abstract = {Energy-starved microbes in deep marine sediments subsist at near-zero growth for thousands of years, yet the mechanisms for their subsistence are unknown because no model strains have been cultivated from most of these groups. We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group {OPB}41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group {II} lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and {NAD}+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group {OPB}41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes ({SAGs}) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter {YddG} was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies.
	{IMPORTANCE} Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.},

By using a shotgun proteomic approach, a total of 3035 proteins matching one or more peptides were detected from four {POM} samples, 505 of which were identified as high-confidence proteins matching two or more peptides. Cyanobacteria was the largest contributor throughout the water column, while crustaceans and dinophytes were the two major groups contributing to the particulate proteins in the {POM} collected from 200 m. Subcellular locations and biological processes of particulate proteins varied significantly between the 41-m and 200-m layers: photosynthesis-associated proteins were highly abundant in the 41-m layer while tubulins and actins accumulated in the midwaters, especially at the 200-m layer. Porins, adenosine triphosphate synthases, nutrient transporters, molecular chaperones, and ectoenzymes were frequently detected in the {POM} samples and presented different distribution patterns within the water column, revealing complex biological processes at the different water layers and/or during the sinking of {POM}. The sources of surface and midwater particulate proteins are different, and the cellular metabolism, generation of energy, and transport processes in {POM} are attenuated rapidly down ocean water column. Zooplankton fecal pellet packages and membrane encapsulation might play important roles in protecting particulate proteins from degradation.},

The material not identified at the molecular level is called “uncharacterized”. Several processes account for this transformation of organic matter: aggregation/disaggregation of particles resulting in incorporation of older and more degraded material; recombination of organic compounds into geomacromolecules; and selective preservation of specific biomacromolecules. Furthermore, microbial activities may introduce new cell wall or other biomass material that is not easily characterized, or they may produce such material as a metabolic product. In addition, black carbon produced by combustion processes may compose a fraction of the uncharacterized organic matter, as it is not analyzed in standard biochemical techniques. Despite these poorly-defined compositional changes that hinder chemical identification, the vast majority of organic matter in sinking particles remains accessible to and is ultimately remineralized by marine microbes.},

The unrecycled fraction of this organic matter can become buried in ocean sediments, thus sequestering carbon and so influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations3. The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques4. Here, using solid-state 13C {NMR} spectroscopy5, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean4 and the Arabian Sea6. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination7 or microbial biosynthesis8, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

	abstract = {Compositions and fluxes of amino acids and major chloropigments were measured in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean as part of the {US} {JGOFS} {EqPac} program. Fluxes decreased by several orders of magnitude, from 400 to 0.03mg amino acid m−2d−1 and from 9mg to 0.0004μg chloropigment m−2d−1, between production in the surface waters and accumulation at the sea floor. Most rapid losses were in surface waters and at the sediment interface. Losses from the mid-water column were as great as those in surface waters or at the sediment interface, but occurred over a much greater depth range. Export flux estimates based on floating sediment traps were higher near the equator and decreased poleward, similar to primary production. Little meridional difference was apparent in composition of either amino acids or pigments in exported material over the 24° of latitude sampled in spite of the large (factor of 5–6) difference in fluxes. However, pigment composition changed dramatically with depth in the water column, and considerable diagenesis occurred before particles reached the sediment. Pigment compositions suggest that suspended particles were more degraded in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, possibly due to differences in food chain structure. Compositional changes in amino acids occurred in the water column, but were most noticeable at the sediment–seawater interface. Increases in the relative proportions of aspartic acid and glycine with depth were more consistent with preferential preservation within the particulate matrix than with any inherent stability of these compounds to heterotrophic consumption. The contribution of amino acids and pigments to total organic carbon clearly shows that selective degradation of organic matter occurs with depth; this is not evident from total organic carbon data alone. Amino acids contributed about a quarter of the total organic carbon ({OC}) in surface waters and 16\% of the {OC} in sediment; pigments decreased from 1\% of total {OC} in surface waters to {\textless}0.001\% in sediments. Decreases in the contribution of amino acids to total organic carbon may be due to transformation into uncharacterizeable material as well as to respiration.},

Analysis of products from the bacterial degradation of proteins in both seawater and sediment pore water revealed the creation and release of peptide intermediates into the medium. Peptides observed in seawater degradation experiments were all less than 40 amino acids long, whereas sedimentary digestions of the same protein generated peptide fragments in the pore water ranging from 110 to 508 amino acids in length. Neither of the environments demonstrated recurring cleavages adjacent to one amino acid or functional group that might be indicative of the action of a single protease. Instead, it appears that a mixture of bacterial proteases were involved in the degradation of protein. The {MALDI}-{TOF}-{MS} method presented, in combination with these results, can help us delineate some of the processes responsible in the initial stages of degradation and better understand how proteins are partitioned between dissolved and solid phases in marine systems.},

Base-extracted material accounts for {\textasciitilde}30\% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}10\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is relatively enriched in glycine ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%), lysine ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%), and non-protein amino acids ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3–10 and 10–100 {kDa} size fractions ({\textasciitilde}10\% and 42\% of base-extractable {THAA}, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The {\textgreater}100 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}38\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10–100 {kDa} and {\textgreater}100 {kDa}) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.},

Typically, microbial activity in the deep biosphere is calculated by transport-reaction modelling of pore water solutes or from experimental measurements involving radiotracers. Here we modelled microbial activity from the degree of D:L-aspartic acid racemization in microbial necromass (remains of dead microbial biomass) in sediments up to ten million years old. This recently developed approach (D:L-amino acid modelling) does not require incubation experiments and is highly sensitive in stable, low-activity environments. We applied for the first time newly established constraints on several important input parameters of the D:L-amino acid model, such as a higher aspartic acid racemization rate constant and a lower cell-specific carbon content of sub-seafloor microorganisms. Our model results show that the pool of necromass amino acids is turned over by microbial activity every few thousand years, while the turnover times of vegetative cells are in the order of years to decades. Notably, microbial turnover times in million-year-old sediment from the Peru Margin are up to 100-fold shorter than previous estimates, highlighting the influence of microbial activities on element cycling over geologic time scales.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23\% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ∼39\% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40\%, 11\%, and 10\%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.},

This rise in temperature has triggered hydrological and geochemical changes that increasingly release carbon-rich water into the coastal ocean via increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of the semi-permanent permafrost ubiquitous in the region. To determine the biogeochemical impacts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter ({tDOM}) on marine ecosystems we compared the nutrient stocks and bacterial communities present under ice-covered and ice-free conditions, assessed the lability of Arctic {tDOM} to coastal microbial communities from the Chukchi Sea, and identified bacterial taxa that respond to rapid increases in {tDOM}. Once thought to be predominantly refractory, we found that ∼7\% of dissolved organic carbon and ∼38\% of dissolved organic nitrogen from {tDOM} was bioavailable to receiving marine microbial communities on short 4 – 6 day time scales. The addition of {tDOM} shifted bacterial community structure toward more copiotrophic taxa and away from more oligotrophic taxa. Although no single order was found to respond universally (positively or negatively) to the {tDOM} addition, this study identified 20 indicator species as possible sentinels for increased {tDOM}. These data suggest the true ecological impact of {tDOM} will be widespread across many bacterial taxa and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated.},

	abstract = {Copper-transporting {ATPase} {ATP}7A is essential for mammalian copper homeostasis. Loss of {ATP}7A activity is associated with fatal Menkes disease ({MD}) and various other pathologies. In cells, {ATP}7A inactivation disrupts copper transport from cytosol into the secretory pathway. Using fibroblasts from {MD} patients and mouse 3T3-L1 cells with a {CRISPR}/Cas9 inactivated {ATP}7A, we demonstrate that {ATP}7A dysfunction is also damaging to mitochondrial redox balance. In these cells, copper accumulates in nuclei, cytosol, and mitochondria, causing distinct changes in their redox environment. Quantitative imaging of live cells using {GRX}1-{roGFP}2 and {HyPer} sensors reveals highest glutathione oxidation and elevation of H2O2 in mitochondria, whereas the redox environment of nuclei and cytosol is much less affected. Decreasing the H2O2 levels in mitochondria with {MitoQ} does not prevent glutathione oxidation, i.e. elevated copper, and not H2O2 is a primary cause of glutathione oxidation. Redox misbalance does not significantly affect mitochondria morphology or activity of respiratory complex {IV} but markedly increases cell sensitivity to even mild glutathione depletion, resulting in loss of cell viability. Thus, {ATP}7A activity protects mitochondria from excessive copper entry, which is deleterious to redox buffers. Mitochondrial redox mis-balance could significantly contribute to pathologies associated with {ATP}7A inactivation in tissues with paradoxical accumulation of copper (i.e. renal epithelia).},

High levels of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase ({PAM}), an essential peptide processing enzyme, occur in the anterior pituitary. {PAM}, which converts glycine-extended peptides into amidated products, requires copper and zinc to support its two catalytic activities and calcium for structure. We used X-ray fluorescence microscopy on rat pituitary sections and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on subcellular fractions prepared from rat anterior pituitary to localize and quantify copper, zinc and calcium. X-ray fluorescence microscopy indicated that the calcium concentration in pituitary tissue was about 2.5 {mM}, 10-times more than zinc and 50-times more than copper. Although no higher than cytosolic levels, secretory granule levels of copper exceeded {PAM} levels by a factor of 10. Atp7a, which transports copper into the lumen of the secretory pathway, was enriched in endosomes and Golgi, not in secretory granules. If Atp7a transfers copper directly to {PAM}, this {pH}-dependent process is likely to occur in Golgi and endosomes.},

Diet is a recognized risk factor in the {NAFLD} spectrum, which includes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}) and fibrosis. Low hepatic copper (Cu) was recently linked to clinical {NAFLD}/{NASH} severity. Simple sugar consumption including sucrose and fructose is implicated in {NAFLD}, while consumption of these macronutrients also decreases liver Cu levels. Though dietary sugar and low Cu are implicated in {NAFLD}, transcript-level responses that connect diet and pathology are not established. We have developed a mature rat model of {NAFLD} induced by dietary Cu deficiency, human-relevant high sucrose intake (30\% w/w) or both factors in combination. Compared to the control diet with adequate Cu and 10\% (w/w) sucrose, rats fed either high-sucrose or low-Cu diet had increased hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrogenesis, including hepatic stellate cell activation, while the combination of diet factors also increased {ATP} citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase gene transcription (fold change {\textgreater} 2, P {\textless} 0.02). Low dietary Cu decreased hepatic and serum Cu (P ≤ 0.05), promoted lipid peroxidation and induced {NAFLD}-like histopathology, while the combined factors also induced fasting hepatic insulin resistance and liver damage. Neither low Cu nor 30\% sucrose in the diet led to enhanced weight gain. Taken together, transcript profiles, histological and biochemical data indicate that low Cu and high sucrose promote hepatic gene expression and physiological responses associated with {NAFLD} and {NASH}, even in the absence of obesity or severe steatosis.},

Lack of any of the four {AP}-1 subunits impairs function, and patients with {MEDNIK} syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by lack of expression of the σ1A subunit, exhibit clinical and biochemical signs of impaired copper homeostasis. To explore the role of {AP}-1 in copper homeostasis in neuroendocrine cells, we used corticotrope tumor cells in which {AP}-1 function was diminished by reducing expression of its μ1A subunit. Copper levels were unchanged when {AP}-1 function was impaired, but cellular levels of Atp7a declined slightly. The ability of {PAM} to function was assessed by monitoring 18-{kDa} fragment-{NH}2 production from proopiomelanocortin. Reduced {AP}-1 function made 18-{kDa} fragment amidation more sensitive to inhibition by bathocuproine disulfonate, a cell-impermeant Cu(I) chelator. The endocytic trafficking of {PAM} was altered, and {PAM}-1 accumulated on the cell surface when {AP}-1 levels were reduced. Reduced {AP}-1 function increased the Atp7a presence in early/recycling endosomes but did not alter the ability of copper to stimulate its appearance on the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation of a small fraction of {PAM} and Atp7a supports the suggestion that copper can be transferred directly from Atp7a to {PAM}, a process that can occur only when both proteins are present in the same subcellular compartment. Altered luminal cuproenzyme function may contribute to deficits observed when the {AP}-1 function is compromised.},

Future methodological developments could provide new capabilities such as characterizing long-term ecosystem changes, biogeochemical reaction rates, and in situ stoichiometries. Yet challenges remain for ocean metaproteomics due to the great biological diversity that produces highly complex mass spectra, as well as the difficulty in obtaining and working with environmental samples.

Here we investigate the offshore Eastern Tropical North Pacific ({ETNP}) where a secondary chlorophyll a maximum resides within the {ODZ}. Rates of primary production and carbon export from the mixed layer and productivity in the primary chlorophyll a maximum were consistent with oligotrophic waters. However, sediment trap carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased between 105 and 150 m, indicating organic matter production within the {ODZ}. Metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization indicated that the secondary chlorophyll a maximum was attributable to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, and numerous photosynthesis and carbon fixation proteins were detected. The presence of chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospina and detection of nitrate oxidoreductase was consistent with cyanobacterial oxygen production within the {ODZ}. Cyanobacteria and cyanophage were also present on large ({\textgreater}30 μm) particles and in sediment trap material. Particle cyanophage-to-host ratio exceeded 50, suggesting that viruses help convert cyanobacteria into sinking organic matter. Nitrate reduction and anammox proteins were detected, congruent with previously reported N2 production. We suggest that autochthonous organic matter production within the {ODZ} contributes to N2 production in the offshore {ETNP}.},

A decade has passed since the term "metaproteomics" was first coined and corresponding analyses were carried out on mixed microbial communities. Since then metaproteomics has yielded many important insights into microbial ecosystem function in the various environmental settings where it has been applied. Although initial progress in analytical capacities and resulting numbers of proteins identified was extremely fast, this trend slowed rapidly. Here, we discuss several representative metaproteomic investigations of activated sludge, acid mine drainage biofilms, freshwater and seawater microbial communities, soil, and human gut microbiota. By using these case studies, we highlight current challenges and possible solutions for metaproteomics to realize its full potential, i.e. to enable conclusive links between microbial community composition, physiology, function, interactions, ecology, and evolution in situ.},

While the standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative controls, most small-scale {AP}-{MS} studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait-independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple {AP}-{MS} studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol.

Here, we document a transition from Bacteria- to Archaea-dominated communities in microbial biofilms sampled from the Richmond Mine acid mine drainage ({AMD}) system (∼{pH} 1.0, ∼38°C) and in laboratory-cultivated biofilms. This transition occurs when chemoautotrophic microbial communities that develop at the air-solution interface sink to the sediment-solution interface and degrade under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The archaea identified in these sunken biofilms are from the class Thermoplasmata, and in some cases, the highly divergent {ARMAN} nanoarchaeal lineage. In several of the sunken biofilms, nanoarchaea comprise 10 to 25\% of the community, based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and metagenomic analyses. Comparative community proteomic analyses show a persistence of bacterial proteins in sunken biofilms, but there is clear evidence for amino acid modifications due to acid hydrolysis. Given the low representation of bacterial cells in sunken biofilms based on microscopy, we infer that hydrolysis reflects proteins derived from lysed cells. For archaea, we detected ∼2,400 distinct proteins, including a subset involved in proteolysis and peptide uptake. Laboratory cultivation experiments using complex carbon substrates demonstrated anaerobic enrichment of Ferroplasma and Aplasma coupled to the reduction of ferric iron. These findings indicate dominance of acidophilic archaea in degrading biofilms and suggest that they play roles in anaerobic nutrient cycling at low {pH}.},

Extracting the protein component from sediments and soils for mass spectral characterization and identification represents a substantial challenge given the range of products and functionalities present in the complex matrix. Multiple forms of gel electrophoresis were evaluated as a means of enhancing recovery of sedimentary protein before proteomic characterization and compared with a direct enzymatic digestion of proteins in sediments. Resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed using shotgun proteomics and tandem mass spectra were evaluated with {SEQUEST}. Multiple databases were then evaluated to examine the ability to confidently identify proteins from environmental samples. Following evaluation of electrophoretic extraction of proteins from sediments, the recovery of an experimentally added standard protein ({BSA}) from older ({\textgreater}1 ky) sediments was optimized. Protein extraction from sediments via direct electrophoresis of a slurry mixture and the specified extraction buffer resulted in the greatest number of confident protein identifications and highest sequence coverage of the {BSA} standard. Searching tandem mass spectral data against larger databases with a higher diversity of proteomes did not yield a greater number of, or more confidence in, protein identifications. Regardless of the protein database used, identified peptides correlated to proteins with the same function across taxa. This suggests that while determining taxonomic-level information remains a challenge in samples with unknown mixed species, it is possible to confidently assign the function of the identified protein.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.3389/fmicb.2017.00057},
	abstract = {Despite their potential importance as analogs of primitive microbial metabolisms, the knowledge of the structure and functioning of the deep ecosystems associated with serpentinizing environments is hampered by the lack of accessibility to relevant systems. These hyperalkaline environments are depleted in dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), making the carbon sources and assimilation pathways in the associated ecosystems highly enigmatic. The Prony Bay Hydrothermal Field ({PHF}) is an active serpentinization site where, similar to Lost City (Mid-Atlantic Ridge), high-{pH} fluids rich in H2 and {CH}4 are discharged from carbonate chimneys at the seafloor, but in a shallower lagoonal environment. This study aimed to characterize the subsurface microbial ecology of this environment by focusing on the earliest stages of chimney construction, dominated by the discharge of hydrothermal fluids of subseafloor origin. By jointly examining the mineralogy and the microbial diversity of the conduits of juvenile edifices at the micrometric scale, we find a central role of uncultivated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes in the ecology of the {PHF}. These bacteria, along with members of the phyla Acetothermia and Omnitrophica, are identified as the first chimneys inhabitants before archaeal Methanosarcinales. They are involved in the construction and early consolidation of the carbonate structures via organomineralization processes. Their predominance in the most juvenile and nascent hydrothermal chimneys, and their affiliation with environmental subsurface microorganisms, indicate that they are likely discharged with hydrothermal fluids from the subseafloor. They may thus be representative of endolithic serpentinization-based ecosystems, in an environment where {DIC} is limited. In contrast, heterotrophic and fermentative microorganisms may consume organic compounds from the abiotic by-products of serpentinization processes and/or from life in the deeper subsurface. We thus propose that the Firmicutes identified at {PHF} may have a versatile metabolism with the capability to use diverse organic compounds from biological or abiotic origin. From that perspective, this study sheds new light on the structure of deep microbial communities living at the energetic edge in serpentinites and may provide an alternative model of the earliest metabolisms.},

	abstract = {Heterotrophic marine bacterioplankton are a critical component of the carbon cycle, processing nearly a quarter of annual primary production, yet defining how substrate utilization preferences and resource partitioning structure microbial communities remains a challenge. In this study, proteomic stable isotope probing (proteomic {SIP}) was used to characterize population-specific assimilation of dissolved free amino acids ({DFAAs}), a major source of dissolved organic carbon for bacterial secondary production in aquatic environments. Microcosms of seawater collected from Newport, Oregon, and Monterey Bay, California, were incubated with 1 µM 13C-labeled amino acids for 15 and 32 h. The taxonomic compositions of microcosm metaproteomes were highly similar to those of the sampled natural communities, with Rhodobacteriales, {SAR}11, and Flavobacteriales representing the dominant taxa. Analysis of 13C incorporation into protein biomass allowed for quantification of the isotopic enrichment of identified proteins and subsequent determination of differential amino acid assimilation patterns between specific bacterioplankton populations. Proteins associated with Rhodobacterales tended to have a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, opposite the trend for Flavobacteriales and {SAR}11 proteins. Rhodobacterales proteins associated with amino acid transport and metabolism had an increased frequency of 13C-enriched spectra at time point 2. Alteromonadales proteins also had a significantly high frequency of 13C-enriched peptides, particularly within ribosomal proteins, demonstrating their rapid growth during incubations. Overall, proteomic {SIP} facilitated quantitative comparisons of {DFAA} assimilation by specific taxa, both between sympatric populations and between protein functional groups within discrete populations, allowing an unprecedented examination of population level metabolic responses to resource acquisition in complex microbial communities.
	{IMPORTANCE} An estimated 50 gigatons of carbon is annually fixed within marine systems, of which heterotrophic microbial populations process nearly half. These communities vary in composition and activity across spatial and temporal scales, so understanding how these changes affect global processes requires the delineation of functional roles for individual members. In a step toward ascertaining these roles, we applied proteomic stable isotope probing to quantify the assimilation of organic carbon from {DFAAs} into microbial protein biomass, since the turnover of {DFAAs} accounts for a substantial fraction of marine microbial carbon metabolism that is directed into biomass production. We conducted experiments at two coastal North Pacific locations and found taxonomically distinct responses. This approach allowed us to compare amino acid assimilation by specific bacterioplankton populations and characterize their allocation of this substrate among cellular functions.},

	abstract = {We report here a systematic evaluation of a multiplex mass spectrometry method coupled with ion mobility separation ({HD}-{MSE}) for the identification and quantification of proteins in the chloroplast stroma. We show that this method allows the robust quantification of reference proteins in mixtures, and it detects concentration differences with high sensitivity when three replicas are performed. Applied to the analysis of the chloroplast stroma proteome, {HD}-{MSE} identified and quantified many chloroplast proteins that were not previously identified in large-scale proteome analyses, suggesting {HD}-{MSE} as a suitable complementary tool for discovery proteomics. We find that {HD}-{MSE} tends to underestimate protein abundances at concentrations above 25 fmol, which is likely due to ion transmission loss and detector saturation. This limitation can be circumvented by omitting the ion mobility separation step in the {HD}-{MSE} workflow. The robustness of protein quantification is influenced by the selection of peptides and their intensity distribution, therefore critical scrutiny of quantification results is required. Based on the {HD}-{MSE} quantification of chloroplast stroma proteins we performed a meta-analysis and compared published quantitative data with our results, using a parts per million normalization scheme. Important pathways in the chloroplast stroma show quantitative stability against different experimental conditions and quantification strategies.
	Biological significance
	Our analysis establishes {MSE}-based Hi3 quantification as a tool for the absolute quantification of proteins in the chloroplast stroma. The meta-analysis performed with a parts per million normalization scheme shows that quantitative proteomics data acquired in different labs and with different quantification strategies yield comparable results for some metabolic pathways, while others show a higher variability. Our data therefore indicate that such meta-analyses allow distinguishing robust from fine-controlled metabolic pathways.},

The Bering Sea is a highly productive system dominated by seasonal blooms and was used as a model system for algal proteins to be tracked through the water column and incorporated into detrital sedimentary material. Samples of suspended and sinking particles were collected at multiple depths along with surface sediments on the continental shelf and deeper basin of the Bering Sea. Modified standard proteomic preparations were used in conjunction with high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify the suite of proteins present and monitor changes in their distribution. In surface waters 207 proteins were identified, decreasing through the water column to 52 proteins identified in post-bloom shelf surface sediments and 24 proteins in deeper (3490 m) basin sediments. The vast majority of identified proteins in all samples were diatom in origin, reflecting their dominant contribution of biomass during the spring bloom. Identified proteins were predominantly from metabolic, binding/structural, and transport-related protein groups. Significant linear correlations were observed between the number of proteins identified and the concentration of total hydrolysable amino acids normalized to carbon and nitrogen. Organelle-bound, transmembrane, photosynthetic, and other proteins involved in light harvesting were preferentially retained during recycling. These findings suggest that organelle and membrane protection represent important mechanisms that enhance the preservation of protein during transport and incorporation into sediments.},

Quantification is done with both precursor- and fragment-ion intensities. Furthermore, {DIA}-Umpire enables targeted extraction of quantitative information based on peptides initially identified in only a subset of the samples, resulting in more consistent quantification across multiple samples. We demonstrated the performance of the method with control samples of varying complexity and publicly available glycoproteomics and affinity purification–{MS} data.},

	abstract = {Metaproteomics characterizes proteins expressed by microorganism communities (microbiome) present in environmental samples or a host organism (e.g. human), revealing insights into the molecular functions conferred by these communities. Compared to conventional proteomics, metaproteomics presents unique data analysis challenges, including the use of large protein databases derived from hundreds or thousands of organisms, as well as numerous processing steps to ensure high data quality. These challenges limit the use of metaproteomics for many researchers. In response, we have developed an accessible and flexible metaproteomics workflow within the Galaxy bioinformatics framework. Via analysis of human oral tissue exudate samples, we have established a modular Galaxy-based workflow that automates a reduction method for searching large sequence databases, enabling comprehensive identification of host proteins (human) as well as "meta-proteins" from the nonhost organisms. Downstream, automated processing steps enable basic local alignment search tool analysis and evaluation/visualization of peptide sequence match quality, maximizing confidence in results. Outputted results are compatible with tools for taxonomic and functional characterization (e.g. Unipept, {MEGAN}5). Galaxy also allows for the sharing of complete workflows with others, promoting reproducibility and also providing a template for further modification and enhancement. Our results provide a blueprint for establishing Galaxy as a solution for metaproteomic data analysis.

Currently, there are many specialized methods that can be used to extract pure biomolecules, such as solution-based and column-based protocols. Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods. The technology should allow a high throughput of samples; the yield, purity, reproducibility, and scalability of the biomolecules as well as the speed, accuracy, and reliability of the assay should be maximal, while minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.},

	abstract = {Motivation: One of the major problems in shotgun proteomics is the low peptide coverage when analyzing complex protein samples. Identifying more peptides, e.g. non-tryptic peptides, may increase the peptide coverage and improve protein identification and/or quantification that are based on the peptide identification results. Searching for all potential non-tryptic peptides is, however, time consuming for shotgun proteomics data from complex samples, and poses a challenge for a routine data analysis.
	Results: We hypothesize that non-tryptic peptides are mainly created from the truncation of regular tryptic peptides before separation. We introduce the notion of truncatability of a tryptic peptide, i.e. the probability of the peptide to be identified in its truncated form, and build a predictor to estimate a peptide's truncatability from its sequence. We show that our predictions achieve useful accuracy, with the area under the {ROC} curve from 76\% to 87\%, and can be used to filter the sequence database for identifying truncated peptides. After filtering, only a limited number of tryptic peptides with the highest truncatability are retained for non-tryptic peptide searching. By applying this method to identification of semi-tryptic peptides, we show that a significant number of such peptides can be identified within a searching time comparable to that of tryptic peptide identification.

We used comparative membrane metaproteomics to identify functional responses of communities to different nutrient concentrations on an oceanic scale. Comparative analyses of microbial membrane fractions revealed shifts in nutrient utilization and energy transduction along an environmental gradient in South Atlantic surface waters, from a low-nutrient gyre to a highly productive coastal upwelling region. The dominant membrane proteins identified (19\%) were {TonB}-dependent transporters ({TBDTs}), which are known to utilize a proton motive force to transport nutrients across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The ocean-wide importance of {TonB}-dependent nutrient acquisition in marine bacteria was unsuspected. Diverse light-harvesting rhodopsins were detected in membrane proteomes from every sample. Proteomic evidence of both {TBDTs} and rhodopsins in the same lineages suggest that phototrophic bacterioplankton have the potential to use energy from light to fuel transport activities. We also identified viral proteins in every sample and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase proteins in the upwelling region, suggesting that Archaea are important nitrifiers in nutrient-rich surface waters.},

We performed the qualitative/quantitative characterization of the salivary proteome/peptidome of 32 Wilson's disease patients by an integrated top-down/bottom-up approach. Patients exhibited significant higher levels of S100A9 and S100A8 proteoforms, and their oxidized forms with respect to controls. Oxidation occurred on methionine and tryptophan residues, and on the unique cysteine residue, in position 42 in S100A8, and 3 in S100A9, that generated glutathionylated, cysteinylated, sulfinic, sulfonic, and disulfide dimeric forms. Wilson's disease patient saliva showed high levels of two new fragments of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and of α-defensins 2 and 4. Overall, the salivary proteome of Wilson's disease patients reflected oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions characteristic of the pathology, highlighting differences that could be useful clues of disease exacerbation.},

We addressed this challenge with a targeted metaproteomics workflow for {NtcA} and P-{II}, two nitrogen regulatory proteins, and demonstrated its application for cyanobacterial taxa within microbial samples from the Central Pacific Ocean. Using {METATRYP}, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less. The related cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus shared an average of 4.8 ± 1.9\% of their tryptic peptides, while shared intraspecies peptides were higher, 13 ± 15\% shared peptides between 12 Prochlorococcus genomes. An {NtcA} peptide was found to target multiple cyanobacteria species, whereas a P-{II} peptide showed specificity to the high-light Prochlorococcus ecotype. Distributions of {NtcA} and P-{II} in the Central Pacific Ocean were similar except at the Equator likely due to differential nitrogen stress responses between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The number of unique tryptic peptides coded for within three combined oceanic microbial metagenomes was estimated to be ∼4 × 10(7) , 1000-fold larger than an individual microbial proteome and 27-fold larger than the human proteome, yet still 20 orders of magnitude lower than the peptide diversity possible in all protein space, implying that peptide mapping algorithms should be able to withstand the added level of complexity in metaproteomic samples.},

Among the methods available for investigation of microbial communities, metaproteomics can approximate the activity of microorganisms by investigating the protein content of a sample. Although metaproteomics is a very powerful method, issues within the bioinformatic evaluation impede its success. In particular, construction of databases for protein identification, grouping of redundant proteins as well as taxonomic and functional annotation pose big challenges.

Our analysis is based on two publicly available reference data sets, {BIATECH}-54 and {CPTAC}, which were developed for the purpose of assessing methods used in label-free differential proteomic studies.

The total {EEA} is the sum of cell-bound (i.e., cell-attached), and dissolved (i.e., cell-free) enzyme activities. Cell-free enzymes make up a substantial proportion (up to 100\%) of the total marine {EEA}. Although we are learning more about how microbial diversity and function (including total {EEA}) will be affected by environmental changes, little is known about what factors control the importance of the abundant cell-free enzymes. Since cell-attached {EEAs} are linked to the cell, their fate will likely be linked to the factors controlling the cell’s fate. In contrast, cell-free enzymes belong to a kind of “living dead” realm because they are not attached to a living cell but still are able to perform their function away from the cell; and as such, the factors controlling their activity and fate might differ from those affecting cell-attached enzymes. This article aims to place cell-free {EEA} into the wider context of hydrolysis of organic matter, deal with recent studies assessing what controls the production, activity and lifetime of cell-free {EEA}, and what their fate might be in response to environmental stressors. This perspective article advocates the need to go “beyond the living things”, studying the response of cells/organisms to different stressors, but also to study cell-free enzymes, in order to fully constrain the future and evolution of marine biogeochemical cycles.},

	abstract = {Background
	The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, having multiple ecotypes of distinct genotypic/phenotypic traits and being the first documented example of genome shrinkage in free-living organisms, offers an ideal system for studying niche-driven molecular micro-diversity in closely related microbes. The present study, through an extensive comparative analysis of various genomic/proteomic features of 6 high light ({HL}) and 6 low light ({LL}) adapted strains, makes an attempt to identify molecular determinants associated with their vertical niche partitioning.
	
	Results
	Pronounced strand-specific asymmetry in synonymous codon usage is observed exclusively in {LL} strains. Distinct dinucleotide abundance profiles are exhibited by 2 {LL} strains with larger genomes and G+C-content ≈ 50\% (group {LLa}), 4 {LL} strains having reduced genomes and G+C-content ≈ 35-37\% (group {LLb}), and 6 {HL} strains. Taking into account the emergence of {LLa}, {LLb} and {HL} strains (based on 16S {rRNA} phylogeny), a gradual increase in average aromaticity, {pI} values and beta- \& coil-forming propensities and a decrease in mean hydrophobicity, instability indices and helix-forming propensities of core proteins are observed. Greater variations in orthologous gene repertoire are found between {LLa} and {LLb} strains, while higher number of positively selected genes exist between {LL} and {HL} strains.
	
	Conclusion
	Strains of different Prochlorococcus groups are characterized by distinct compositional, physicochemical and structural traits that are not mere remnants of a continuous genetic drift, but are potential outcomes of a grand scheme of niche-oriented stepwise diversification, that might have driven them chronologically towards greater stability/fidelity and invoked upon them a special ability to inhabit diverse oceanic environments.},

The target-decoy search strategy has emerged as a simple, effective tool for generating such estimations. This strategy is based on the premise that obvious, necessarily incorrect “decoy” sequences added to the search space will correspond with incorrect search results that might otherwise be deemed to be correct. With this knowledge, it is possible not only to estimate how many incorrect results are in a final data set but also to use decoy hits to guide the design of filtering criteria that sensitively partition a data set into correct and incorrect identifications.},

Here we present a detergent based, heat-assisted cellular lysis method coupled with trichloroacetic acid ({TCA}) precipitation of soil microbial proteins that has been developed in our lab and found to be reasonably robust and unbiased in extracting microbial proteins from a broad range of soils for downstream mass spectrometric characterizations of microbial metabolic activities in natural ecosystems.},

Our analysis identifies significant phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition undetected by previous studies due to small sample sizes and the large inherent variability in macromolecular pools. The phylogenetic differences in macromolecular composition lead to variations in carbon-to-nitrogen ratios that are consistent with independent observations. These phylogenetic differences in macromolecular and elemental composition reflect adaptations in cellular architecture and biochemistry; specifically in the cell wall, the light harvesting apparatus, and storage pools.},

We estimate the cellular abundance of 92\% of the proteins in the yeast proteome and assess the variation in each abundance measurement.

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and pyrosequencing of 16S {rRNA} genes were combined to investigate bacterial diversity and community composition on limnic and coastal marine particles {\textgreater} 5 and {\textgreater} 10 μm respectively. Limnic particles were more abundant (average: 1 × 10(7) l(-1)), smaller in size (average areas: 471 versus 2050 μm(2)) and more densely colonized (average densities: 7.3 versus 3.6 cells 100 μm(-2)) than marine ones.

Marine particles were colonized by Planctomycetes and Betaproteobacteria additionally to Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria. Large differences in individual particle colonization could be detected. High-throughput sequencing revealed a significant overlap of {PA} and free-living ({FL}) bacteria highlighting an underestimated connectivity between both fractions. {PA} bacteria were in 14/21 cases more diverse than {FL} bacteria, reflecting a high heterogeneity in the particle microenvironment. We propose that a ratio of Chao 1 indices of {PA}/{FL} {\textless} 1 indicates the presence of rather homogeneously colonized particles. The identification of different bacterial families enriched on either limnic or marine particles demonstrates that, despite the seemingly similar ecological niches, {PA} communities of both environments differ substantially.},

In the first approximation, different size filters (0.22 and 5 μm) were used to identify prokaryotic microbes of free-living and particle-attached bacterial communities in the Mediterranean water column. A subtractive metagenomic approach was used to characterize the dominant microbial groups in the large size fraction that were not present in the free-living one. They belonged mainly to Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Flavobacteria and Proteobacteria. In addition, marine microbial communities enriched by incubation with different kinds of particulate material have been studied by metagenomic assembly. Different particle kinds (diatomaceous earth, sand, chitin and cellulose) were colonized by very different communities of bacteria belonging to Roseobacter, Vibrio, Bacteriovorax, and Lacinutrix that were distant relatives of genomes already described from marine habitats. Besides, using assembly from deep metagenomic sequencing from the particle-specific enrichments we were able to determine a total of 20 groups of contigs (eight of them with {\textgreater}50\% completeness) and reconstruct de novo five new genomes of novel species within marine clades ({\textgreater}79\% completeness and {\textless}1.8\% contamination). We also describe for the first time the genome of a marine Rhizobiales phage that seems to infect a broad range of Alphaproteobacteria and live in habitats as diverse as soil, marine sediment and water column. The metagenomic recruitment of the communities found by direct sequencing of the large size filter and by enrichment had nearly no overlap. These results indicate that these reconstructed genomes are part of the rare biosphere which exists at nominal levels under natural conditions.},

We determined the phylogenetic affiliation for the microorganisms growing on aggregates by pyrosequencing partial 16S {rRNA} gene amplicons. Water column samples were also collected and sequenced for comparison between sinking-particle-associated and planktonic bacterial communities. Statistically significant differences were found between the water column and sediment trap bacteria. Relative abundances of Pelagibacter sp. and multiple members of the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, and α-Proteobacteria were elevated in water column samples, while trap samples contained members of the Roseobacter clade of α-Proteobacteria in high relative abundances. Our findings indicated that rapid changes – within 24 h of collection – occurred to the microbial community associated with aggregates from either bloom type. There was a little change in the bacterial assemblage after the initial 24-h incubation period. The most abundant early colonizer was a Sulfitobacter sp. This study provides further evidence that Roseobacters are rapid colonizers of marine aggregates and that colonization can occur on short timescales. This study further demonstrates that particle origin may be insignificant regarding the heterotrophic bacterial population that degrades them.},

The first sequenced genomes of marine Bacteroidetes seemed to confirm this assumption. Many more genomes have been sequenced recently. Here, a comparative analysis of marine Bacteroidetes genomes revealed a life strategy different from those of other important phyla of marine bacterioplankton such as Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes have many adaptations to grow attached to particles, have the capacity to degrade polymers, including a large number of peptidases, glycoside hydrolases ({GHs}), glycosyl transferases, adhesion proteins, as well as the genes for gliding motility. Several of the polymer degradation genes are located in close association with genes for {TonB}-dependent receptors and transducers, suggesting an integrated regulation of adhesion and degradation of polymers. This confirmed the role of this abundant group of marine bacteria as degraders of particulate matter. Marine Bacteroidetes had a significantly larger number of proteases than {GHs}, while non-marine Bacteroidetes had equal numbers of both. Proteorhodopsin containing Bacteroidetes shared two characteristics: small genome size and a higher number of genes involved in {CO}2 fixation per Mb. The latter may be important in order to survive when floating freely in the illuminated, but nutrient-poor, ocean surface.},

In this study, we used particle interceptor traps ({PITs}) to assess the nature of particle-associated microbial communities collected at a variety of depths in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Comparative metagenomics was used to assess differences in microbial taxa and functional gene repertoires in {PITs} containing a preservative (poisoned traps) compared to preservative-free traps where growth was allowed to continue in situ (live traps). Live trap microbial communities shared taxonomic and functional similarities with bacteria previously reported to be enriched in dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) microcosms (e.g., Alteromonas and Methylophaga), in addition to other particle and eukaryote-associated bacteria (e.g., Flavobacteriales and Pseudoalteromonas). Poisoned trap microbial assemblages were enriched in Vibrio and Campylobacterales likely associated with eukaryotic surfaces and intestinal tracts as symbionts, pathogens, or saprophytes. The functional gene content of microbial assemblages in poisoned traps included a variety of genes involved in virulence, anaerobic metabolism, attachment to chitinaceaous surfaces, and chitin degradation. The presence of chitinaceaous surfaces was also accompanied by the co-existence of bacteria which encoded the capacity to attach to, transport and metabolize chitin and its derivatives. Distinctly different microbial assemblages predominated in live traps, which were largely represented by copiotrophs and eukaryote-associated bacterial communities. Predominant sediment trap-assocaited eukaryotic phyla included Dinoflagellata, Metazoa (mostly copepods), Protalveolata, Retaria, and Stramenopiles. These data indicate the central role of eukaryotic taxa in structuring sinking particle microbial assemblages, as well as the rapid responses of indigenous microbial species in the degradation of marine particulate organic matter ({POM}) in situ in the ocean's interior.},

	abstract = {Sixty percent of the world ocean by area is contained in oligotrophic gyres [Longhurst A (1995) Prog Oceanog 36:77–16], the biomass of which is dominated by picophytoplankton, including cyanobacteria and picoeukaryotic algae, as well as picoheterotrophs. Despite their recognized importance in carbon cycling in the surface ocean, the role of small cells and their detrital remains in the transfer of particulate organic matter ({POM}) to the deep ocean remains disputed. Because oligotrophic marine conditions are projected to expand under current climate trends, a better understanding of the role of small particles in the global carbon cycle is a timely goal. Here we use the lipid profiles, radiocarbon, and stable carbon isotopic signatures of lipids from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to show that in the surface ocean, lipids from submicron {POM} (here called extra-small {POM}) are distinct from larger classes of suspended {POM}. Remarkably, this distinct extra-small {POM} signature dominates the total lipids collected at mesopelagic depth, suggesting that the lipid component of mesopelagic {POM} primarily contains the exported remains of small particles. Transfer of submicron material to mesopelagic depths in this location is consistent with model results that claim the biological origin of exported carbon should be proportional to the distribution of cell types in the surface community, irrespective of cell size [Richardson {TL}, Jackson {GA} (2007) Science 315:838–840]. Our data suggest that the submicron component of exported {POM} is an important contributor to the global biological pump, especially in oligotrophic waters.},

	abstract = {Marine particles play a central role in controlling the transport, cycling, and inventories of many major elements and trace elements and isotopes throughout the oceans. Studies seeking to elucidate the biogeochemical roles of marine particles often require reliable ways to collect them from the ocean. Here, we review the oceanographic toolbox of techniques and instrumentation that are employed to collect both suspended and sinking particles. With these tools, it is possible to determine both the concentrations and vertical fluxes of important elements and individual particle types. We describe the various methods for quantifying the concentrations of particulate matter with in situ pumps, towed sampling devices, bottle collectors, and large volume capture devices. The uses of various types of flux collection platforms are discussed including surface tethered, neutrally buoyant, and bottom moored devices. We address the issues of sediment trap collection biases and the apparent inconsistencies that can arise due to differences in the temporal and spatial scales sampled by the various methodologies. Special attention is given to collection considerations made for the analysis of trace metals and isotopes, as these methodologies are of high importance to the ongoing {GEOTRACES} program which seeks to identify the processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean. With the emergence of new particle collection methodologies and the continued reliance on traditional collection methods, it is imperative that we combine these multiple approaches in ways that will help improve their accuracy and precision while enhancing their utility in advancing understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of marine particles.},

Although primary production rates vary markedly across this 9° swath, vertical trends in biochemical compositions remained remarkably parallel. Together these one hundred plus biochemicals account for 80\% of the total organic carbon (C org) in net-plankton and particles sinking from the euphotic zone, but represent only 24 and 20\% of the organic carbon in deep-water particles and surface sediments, respectively. Scaled profiles of relative abundances, clearly illustrate (a) exponential losses of plankton remains and increases in heterotroph biomarkers throughout the water column, (b) elevated proportions of bacterial markers near the sediment surface, and (c) preservation of selected remains of bacteria, phytoplankton and vascular land plants deeper in the sediments. In spite of one of the most comprehensive analyses of major biochemicals yet applied to marine particulate samples, percentages of molecularly uncharacterized organic carbon increase progressively down the water column to values near 80\% in the underlying sediments. The composition, formation pathway and information potential of this uncharatterized fraction are among the most fascinating questions in marine organic geochemistry.},

The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

We investigated the patterns of light-induced particle breakdown and bacterial assimilation of detrital C and N using 13C and 15N labeled freeze-thawed diatom cells incubated in laboratory microcosms with a marine microbial community freshly-collected from the Pacific Ocean. Particles incubated in the dark resulted in increased bacterial counts and dissolved organic carbon concentrations compared to those incubated in the light. Light also influenced the attached and free-living microbial community structure as detected by 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing. For example, bacterial taxa from the Sphingobacteriia were enriched on dark-incubated particles and taxa from the family Flavobacteriaceae and the genus Pseudoalteromonas were numerically enriched on particles in the light. Isotope incorporation analysis by phylogenetic microarray and {NanoSIMS} (a method called Chip-{SIP}) identified free-living and attached microbial taxa able to incorporate N and C from the particles. Some taxa, including members of the Flavobacteriaceae and Cryomorphaceae, exhibited increased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting the use of photoheterotrophic metabolisms. In contrast, some members of Oceanospirillales and Rhodospirillales showed decreased isotope incorporation in the light, suggesting that their heterotrophic metabolism, particularly when occurring on particles, might increase at night or may be inhibited by sunlight. These results show that light influences particle degradation and C and N incorporation by attached bacteria, suggesting that the transfer between particulate and free-living phases are likely affected by external factors that change with the light regime, such as time of day, depth and season.},

	abstract = {Energy-starved microbes in deep marine sediments subsist at near-zero growth for thousands of years, yet the mechanisms for their subsistence are unknown because no model strains have been cultivated from most of these groups. We investigated Baltic Sea sediments with single-cell genomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and enzyme assays to identify possible subsistence mechanisms employed by uncultured Atribacteria, Aminicenantes, Actinobacteria group {OPB}41, Aerophobetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfatiglans, Bathyarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota marine group {II} lineages. Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and {NAD}+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group {OPB}41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes ({SAGs}) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter {YddG} was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells. Subsistence of uncultured phyla in deep subsurface sediments may occur through shared strategies of using chemical protectants for biomolecular stabilization, but also by differentiating into physiological niches and metabolic interdependencies.
	{IMPORTANCE} Much of life on Earth exists in a very slow-growing state, with microbes from deeply buried marine sediments representing an extreme example. These environments are like natural laboratories that have run multi-thousand-year experiments that are impossible to perform in a laboratory. We borrowed some techniques that are commonly used in laboratory experiments and applied them to these natural samples to make hypotheses about how these microbes subsist for so long at low activity. We found that some methods for stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids might be used by many members of the community. We also found evidence for niche differentiation strategies, and possibly cross-feeding, suggesting that even though they are barely growing, complex ecological interactions continue to occur over ultralong timescales.},

Cyanobacteria was the largest contributor throughout the water column, while crustaceans and dinophytes were the two major groups contributing to the particulate proteins in the {POM} collected from 200 m. Subcellular locations and biological processes of particulate proteins varied significantly between the 41-m and 200-m layers: photosynthesis-associated proteins were highly abundant in the 41-m layer while tubulins and actins accumulated in the midwaters, especially at the 200-m layer. Porins, adenosine triphosphate synthases, nutrient transporters, molecular chaperones, and ectoenzymes were frequently detected in the {POM} samples and presented different distribution patterns within the water column, revealing complex biological processes at the different water layers and/or during the sinking of {POM}. The sources of surface and midwater particulate proteins are different, and the cellular metabolism, generation of energy, and transport processes in {POM} are attenuated rapidly down ocean water column.

The material not identified at the molecular level is called “uncharacterized”. Several processes account for this transformation of organic matter: aggregation/disaggregation of particles resulting in incorporation of older and more degraded material; recombination of organic compounds into geomacromolecules; and selective preservation of specific biomacromolecules. Furthermore, microbial activities may introduce new cell wall or other biomass material that is not easily characterized, or they may produce such material as a metabolic product. In addition, black carbon produced by combustion processes may compose a fraction of the uncharacterized organic matter, as it is not analyzed in standard biochemical techniques. Despite these poorly-defined compositional changes that hinder chemical identification, the vast majority of organic matter in sinking particles remains accessible to and is ultimately remineralized by marine microbes.},

The processes controlling the extensive biodegradation of sinking particles remain unclear, partly because of the difficulty in resolving the composition of the residual organic matter at depth with existing chromatographic techniques4. Here, using solid-state 13C {NMR} spectroscopy5, we characterize the chemical structure of organic carbon in both surface plankton and sinking particulate matter from the Pacific Ocean4 and the Arabian Sea6. We found that minimal changes occur in bulk organic composition, despite extensive ({\textgreater}98\%) biodegradation, and that amino-acid-like material predominates throughout the water column in both regions. The compositional similarity between phytoplankton biomass and the small remnant of organic matter reaching the ocean interior indicates that the formation of unusual biochemicals, either by chemical recombination7 or microbial biosynthesis8, is not the main process controlling the preservation of particulate organic carbon within the water column at these two sites. We suggest instead that organic matter might be protected from degradation by the inorganic matrix of sinking particles.},

Fluxes decreased by several orders of magnitude, from 400 to 0.03mg amino acid m−2d−1 and from 9mg to 0.0004μg chloropigment m−2d−1, between production in the surface waters and accumulation at the sea floor. Most rapid losses were in surface waters and at the sediment interface. Losses from the mid-water column were as great as those in surface waters or at the sediment interface, but occurred over a much greater depth range. Export flux estimates based on floating sediment traps were higher near the equator and decreased poleward, similar to primary production. Little meridional difference was apparent in composition of either amino acids or pigments in exported material over the 24° of latitude sampled in spite of the large (factor of 5–6) difference in fluxes. However, pigment composition changed dramatically with depth in the water column, and considerable diagenesis occurred before particles reached the sediment. Pigment compositions suggest that suspended particles were more degraded in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, possibly due to differences in food chain structure. Compositional changes in amino acids occurred in the water column, but were most noticeable at the sediment–seawater interface. Increases in the relative proportions of aspartic acid and glycine with depth were more consistent with preferential preservation within the particulate matrix than with any inherent stability of these compounds to heterotrophic consumption. The contribution of amino acids and pigments to total organic carbon clearly shows that selective degradation of organic matter occurs with depth; this is not evident from total organic carbon data alone. Amino acids contributed about a quarter of the total organic carbon ({OC}) in surface waters and 16\% of the {OC} in sediment; pigments decreased from 1\% of total {OC} in surface waters to {\textless}0.001\% in sediments. Decreases in the contribution of amino acids to total organic carbon may be due to transformation into uncharacterizeable material as well as to respiration.},

The production of peptides during degradation, the size of the peptides produced and the within-protein locations of protease attack were all monitored in an effort to evaluate whether specific types of proteases or specific peptide bond locations were targeted during {BSA} degradation. Analysis of products from the bacterial degradation of proteins in both seawater and sediment pore water revealed the creation and release of peptide intermediates into the medium. Peptides observed in seawater degradation experiments were all less than 40 amino acids long, whereas sedimentary digestions of the same protein generated peptide fragments in the pore water ranging from 110 to 508 amino acids in length. Neither of the environments demonstrated recurring cleavages adjacent to one amino acid or functional group that might be indicative of the action of a single protease. Instead, it appears that a mixture of bacterial proteases were involved in the degradation of protein. The {MALDI}-{TOF}-{MS} method presented, in combination with these results, can help us delineate some of the processes responsible in the initial stages of degradation and better understand how proteins are partitioned between dissolved and solid phases in marine systems.},

Base-extracted material accounts for {\textasciitilde}30\% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}10\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is relatively enriched in glycine ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%), lysine ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%), and non-protein amino acids ({\textasciitilde}5 mol\%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the {\textless}3 {kDa} size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3–10 and 10–100 {kDa} size fractions ({\textasciitilde}10\% and 42\% of base-extractable {THAA}, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ({\textasciitilde}30 mol\%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The {\textgreater}100 {kDa} size fraction ({\textasciitilde}38\% of base-extractable {THAA}) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10–100 {kDa} and {\textgreater}100 {kDa}) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.},

Typically, microbial activity in the deep biosphere is calculated by transport-reaction modelling of pore water solutes or from experimental measurements involving radiotracers. Here we modelled microbial activity from the degree of D:L-aspartic acid racemization in microbial necromass (remains of dead microbial biomass) in sediments up to ten million years old. This recently developed approach (D:L-amino acid modelling) does not require incubation experiments and is highly sensitive in stable, low-activity environments. We applied for the first time newly established constraints on several important input parameters of the D:L-amino acid model, such as a higher aspartic acid racemization rate constant and a lower cell-specific carbon content of sub-seafloor microorganisms. Our model results show that the pool of necromass amino acids is turned over by microbial activity every few thousand years, while the turnover times of vegetative cells are in the order of years to decades. Notably, microbial turnover times in million-year-old sediment from the Peru Margin are up to 100-fold shorter than previous estimates, highlighting the influence of microbial activities on element cycling over geologic time scales.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic composition of the heterotrophic microbial community is depth stratified in the oceanic water column down to abyssopelagic layers. In the layers below the euphotic zone, it has been suggested that heterotrophic microbes rely largely on solubilized particulate organic matter as a carbon and energy source rather than on dissolved organic matter. To decipher whether changes in the phylogenetic composition with depth are reflected in changes in the bacterial and archaeal transporter proteins, we generated an extensive metaproteomic and metagenomic dataset of microbial communities collected from 100- to 5,000-m depth in the Atlantic Ocean. By identifying which compounds of the organic matter pool are absorbed, transported, and incorporated into microbial cells, intriguing insights into organic matter transformation in the deep ocean emerged. On average, solute transporters accounted for 23\% of identified protein sequences in the lower euphotic and ∼39\% in the bathypelagic layer, indicating the central role of heterotrophy in the dark ocean. In the bathypelagic layer, substrate affinities of expressed transporters suggest that, in addition to amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and compatible solutes may be essential substrates for the microbial community. Key players with highest expression of solute transporters were Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, accounting for 40\%, 11\%, and 10\%, respectively, of relative protein abundances. The in situ expression of solute transporters indicates that the heterotrophic prokaryotic community is geared toward the utilization of similar organic compounds throughout the water column, with yet higher abundances of transporters targeting aromatic compounds in the bathypelagic realm.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones are major sites of fixed nitrogen loss in the ocean. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, anammox, in pelagic nitrogen removal. Sources of ammonium for the anammox reaction, however, remain controversial, as heterotrophic denitrification and alternative anaerobic pathways of organic matter remineralization cannot account for the ammonium requirements of reported anammox rates. Here, we explore the significance of microaerobic respiration as a source of ammonium during organic matter degradation in the oxygen-deficient waters off Namibia and Peru. Experiments with additions of double-labelled oxygen revealed high aerobic activity in the upper {OMZs}, likely controlled by surface organic matter export. Consistently observed oxygen consumption in samples retrieved throughout the lower {OMZs} hints at efficient exploitation of vertically and laterally advected, oxygenated waters in this zone by aerobic microorganisms. In accordance, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses identified genes encoding for aerobic terminal oxidases and demonstrated their expression by diverse microbial communities, even in virtually anoxic waters. Our results suggest that microaerobic respiration is a major mode of organic matter remineralization and source of ammonium ({\textasciitilde}45-100\%) in the upper oxygen minimum zones, and reconcile hitherto observed mismatches between ammonium producing and consuming processes therein.},

We show that the spatial extent of hypoxia is highly sensitive to small changes in the ocean’s O2 content, with maximum responses at suboxic concentrations where anaerobic metabolisms predominate. In model-based reconstructions of historical oxygen changes, the world’s largest suboxic zone, in the Pacific Ocean, varies in size by a factor of 2. This is attributable to climate-driven changes in the depth of the tropical and subtropical thermocline that have multiplicative effects on respiration rates in low-O2 water. The same mechanism yields even larger fluctuations in the rate of nitrogen removal by denitrification, creating a link between decadal climate oscillations and the nutrient limitation of marine photosynthesis.

To explore the potential for light sensing in this phototroph, we measured its global gene expression pattern in response to different light qualities and quantities by using high-density Affymetrix microarrays. Though seven different conditions were tested, only blue light elicited a strong response. In addition, hierarchical clustering revealed that the responses to high white light and blue light were very similar and different from that of the lower-intensity white light, suggesting that the actual sensing of high light is mediated via a blue-light receptor. Bacterial cryptochromes seem to be good candidates for the blue-light sensors. The existence of a signaling pathway for the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was suggested by the presence of genes that responded similarly to red and blue light as well as genes that responded to the addition of {DCMU} [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-N-N′-dimethylurea], a specific inhibitor of photosystem {II}-mediated electron transport.},

	Gene gain and loss frequently occurs in the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, a phototroph that numerically dominates tropical and subtropical open oceans. However, little is known about the stabilization of its core genome, which contains approximately 1250 genes, in the context of genome streamlining. Using Prochlorococcus {MED}4 as a model organism, we investigated the constraints on core genome stabilization using transcriptome profiling.
	
	Results
	{RNA}-Seq technique was used to obtain the transcriptome map of Prochlorococcus {MED}4, including operons, untranslated regions, non-coding {RNAs}, and novel genes. Genome-wide expression profiles revealed that three factors contribute to core genome stabilization. First, a negative correlation between gene expression levels and protein evolutionary rates was observed. Highly expressed genes were overrepresented in the core genome but not in the flexible genome. Gene necessity was determined as a second powerful constraint on genome evolution through functional enrichment analysis. Third, quick {mRNA} turnover may increase corresponding proteins’ fidelity among genes that were abundantly expressed. Together, these factors influence core genome stabilization during {MED}4 genome evolution.

	Gene expression, gene necessity, and {mRNA} turnover contribute to core genome maintenance during cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus genus evolution.},

They fluoresce red and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment, as well as chlorophyll b, α-carotene, and zeaxanthin. This unusual combination of pigments, and a distinctive prokaryotic ultrastructure, suggests that these picoplankters are free-living relatives of Prochloron7.

Using a novel peptide-based enrichment analysis, significant changes (p-value {\textless} 0.01) in biological and molecular functions associated with carbon and nitrogen recycling were observed. Within the first day under both organic matter conditions, Bering Strait surface microbiomes increased protein synthesis, carbohydrate degradation, and cellular redox processes while decreasing C1 metabolism. Taxonomic assignments revealed that the core microbiome collectively responded to algal substrates by assimilating carbon before select taxa utilize and metabolize nitrogen intracellularly. Incubations of Chukchi Sea bottom water microbiomes showed similar, but delayed functional responses to identical treatments. Although 24 functional terms were shared between experimental treatments, the timing, and degree of the remaining responses were highly variable, showing that organic matter perturbation directs community functionality prior to alterations to the taxonomic distribution at the microbiome class level. The dynamic responses of these two oceanic microbial communities have important implications for timing and magnitude of responses to organic perturbations within the Arctic Ocean and how community-level functions may forecast biogeochemical gradients in oceans.},

	abstract = {Proteins represent the most abundant class of biomolecules in marine sinking particles and microbial biomass, yet their cycling in marine sediments is not fully understood. To investigate whether some portion of hydrolyzed proteins escapes complete remineralization and accumulate in the pore waters, we analyzed dissolved organic matter from the anoxic sediments of Santa Barbara Basin, California, by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry ({FTICR}-{MS}). The results showed an increase in the molecular diversity and abundance of dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}) formulas with depth. A comparison of the detected {DON} formulas to a database of small peptides (2–4 amino acid sequences) returned 119 matches, and these formulas were most abundant near the sediment surface. When we compared our detected formulas to all possible structures that would result from deamination of peptides in the database, we found 680 formula matches. However, these molecular formulas can represent hundreds of different structural isomers (in the present case as many as 3257 different deaminated peptide structures), which cannot be distinguished by the {FTICR}-{MS} settings that were used. Analysis of amino acid sequences suggests that these deaminated peptides may be the products of selective degradation of source proteins in marine sediments. We hypothesize that these deaminated peptides accumulate in the pore waters due to extracellular proteinases being inhibited from completely hydrolyzing specific peptides to free amino acids. We suggest that anaerobic microbes deaminate peptides largely to produce H2, which is ultimately used as a reducing agent by other sediment microbes (e.g. {CO}2 reduction by methanogens). Simple calculations suggest that deaminated peptides may represent ∼25–45\% of {DOC} accumulating in these sediment pore waters. Unlike rapid remineralization of free amino acids, peptide deamination leaves behind the peptide carbon skeleton. Molecular structures of these remnant carbon skeletons may hold important clues about specific microbial processes influencing organic matter remineralization and accumulation.},

Proteins were identified from tandem mass spectra searched against three different protein databases in order to track proteins from Thalassiosira pseudonana and any potential bacterial contributions. A rapid loss of diatom protein was observed over the incubation period; 75\% of the proteins initially identified were not detected after 72 h of exposure to a microbial population. By the 23rd day, peptides identified with high confidence correlated with only four T. pseudonana proteins. Five factors may have influenced the preservation of diatom proteins: (1) protection within organelles or structures with multiple membranes, (2) the relative cellular abundance in the photosynthetic apparatus, (3) the number of transmembrane domains in the protein sequence, (4) the presence of glycan modification motifs, and (5) the capability of proteins or peptides to aggregate into supramolecules.},

Vertical fluxes of sinking bulk particulate material in this marine bay were elevated during winter and increased in consistent proportion to sediment trap deployment depth throughout the year. Although annual average particle fluxes at 30 and 60 m bracketed the mean accumulation rate of the underlying sediment, the flux at 90 m was higher by a factor of 2 due to resuspension, horizontal advection, or both. The monthly fluxes of lignin-derived phenols paralleled those of total particulate material, indicating a common riverine origin. The annual average fluxes of vanillyl and cinnamyl phenols through the water column closely matched the corresponding accumulation rates in the underlying sediment, whereas about a third of the total syringyl phenol input was degraded at the water- sediment interface. Although p-hydroxyacetophenone exhibited a stability typical of lignin-derived phenols, the distinctly higher reactivities ({\textgreater} 60\% degradation) of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and p-hydroxybenzoic acid indicate a predominantly nonlignin source. On average, 60 and 70\%, respectively, of the total particulate organic carbon and nitrogen and 65–75\% of all neutral sugars settling through the midwater column were degraded at the water- sediment interface. The elemental and carbohydrate composition of the degraded material was similar to that of local net plankton except for higher percentages of glucose and total neutral sugars. Land-derived organic material accounted for about one-third of the total organic carbon passing through the midwater column and two-thirds of the organic carbon accumulating in the underlying sediments. The amounts of plankton-derived organic matter sinking through the midwater column and being preserved in the sediments below corresponded to 14 and 3\% of the annual mean primary productivity. Plankton-derived organic matter exhibited about 5 times the reactivity of local land-derived organic matter at the water-sediment interface of Dabob Bay and supported essentially all of the benthic respiration.},

	abstract = {The vascular land plant biopolymers lignin and cutin were surveyed in the surface sediments of coastal and open ocean waters by controlled alkaline {CuO} oxidation/reaction. Two contrasting oceanic regimes were studied: the northwest Mediterranean ({NWM}) Sea, which receives significant particulate terrigenous debris through riverine discharge; and the northeast Atlantic ({NEA}) Ocean, with poorly characterised terrestrial carbon inputs. In the {NWM} products of lignin and cutin co-occurred at all stations, elevated levels (ca. 0.5–3.0 mg lignin phenols/100 mg organic carbon; ca. 0.01–0.09 mg cutin acids/100 mg organic carbon) were observed for near-shore deltaic and shelf sediments. The influence of terrestrial land plant inputs extended across the shelf and through the slope to the abyssal plain, providing molecular evidence for advective offshore transfer of terrestrial carbon. Mass balance estimates for the basin suggest riverine inputs account for the majority of surface sedimentary lignin/cutin, most of which ({\textgreater}90\%) is deposited on the shelf. Products of {CuO} oxidation of lignin and cutin were also detected in {NEA} surface sediments, at levels comparable to those observed for the {NWM} continental slope, and were detectable at low concentrations (ca. 0.5 μgg−1 in the sediments of the abyssal plains ({\textgreater}4,000 m depth). While atmospheric deposition of lignin/cutin-derived material cannot be discounted in this open ocean system, lateral advective transfer of enriched shelf sediments is inferred as a possible transport process. A progressive enrichment in cutin-derived material relative to lignin was observed offshore, with evidence of an increase in the degree of oxidative alteration of lignin residues. To account for these observations, preferential offshore transport of finer and more degraded material is proposed. Nonspecific oxidation products dominated the gas chromatograms of {NEA} sediments, which appear to originate from marine sources of sedimentary organic carbon. Preliminary mass balance calculations applied to the global ocean margin suggest riverine sources of both particulate lignin and cutin are important and that most ({\textgreater}95\%) deposition of recognisable land plant biopolymers occurs in shelf seas.},

Direct evidence for the presence of terrigenous {DOM} in the open ocean has been found only in dissolved humic substances isolated from surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean2. Here we report the detection of low concentrations of lignin—a biopolymer found only in terrestrial vegetation—in {DOM} collected from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating that terrigenous {DOM} is distributed throughout the ocean water column. Higher lignin concentrations in Atlantic waters, relative to Pacific waters, reflect terrigenous {DOM} concentrations that are 2.6 times higher in the Atlantic. This finding is consistent with the 3.6-times greater riverine water-discharge to the Atlantic Ocean3,4, and with known patterns of ocean circulation5. It appears that terrigenous {DOM} comprises only a small fraction (0.7–2.4\%) of the total {DOM} in the ocean, and that its oceanic residence time (21–132yr) is much shorter than that of marine {DOM}6,7. The regeneration of nutrients during rapid cycling of terrigenous {DOM} could contribute to high rates of primary production in the coastal ocean.},

Here, we have identified the sources of fluorescent {DOM} ({FDOM}) in a high Arctic fjord (Young Sound, {NE} Greenland) influenced by glacial meltwater. The biological transformation of {FDOM} was further investigated using plankton community size-fractionation experiments. The intensity of ultraviolet fluorescence (commonly termed amino acid-like) was highly variable and positively correlated to bacterial production and mesozooplankton grazing. The overall distribution of visible {FDOM} in the fjord was hydrographically driven by the high-signal intrusion of Arctic terrestrial {DOM} from shelf waters and dilution with glacial runoff in the surface waters. However, the high-intensity visible {FDOM} that accumulated in subsurface waters in summer was not solely linked to allochthonous sources. Our data indicate that microbial activity, in particular, protist bacterivory, to be a source. A decrease in visible {FDOM} in subsurface waters was concurrent with an increase in bacterial abundance, indicating an active bacterial uptake or modification of this {DOM} fraction. This was confirmed by net-loss of visible {FDOM} in experiments during summer when bacterial activity was high. The degradation of visible {FDOM} appeared to be associated with bacteria belonging to the order Alteromonadales mainly the genus Glaciecola and the {SAR}92 clade. The findings provide new insight into the character of Arctic terrestrial {DOM} and the biological production and degradation of both visible and {UV} wavelength organic matter in the coastal Arctic.},

	abstract = {In a study of the transport and transformation of particulate amino acids in the Southern Ocean, we found that silicate and calcium carbonate biominerals play an important role in the preservation of amino acids throughout the water column and surface sediments. Plankton, sinking particle and sediment samples were collected during the {USJGOFS} {AESOPS} transect across the Antarctic Polar Front ({APF}) along 170°W. Total hydrolyzable amino acids ({THAA}) made up of 17–27\% of total organic carbon (Corg) in sinking particles and 6–23\% of Corg in surface sediments. In addition to {THAA}, we measured amino acids bound in silicate ({SiTHAA}) and calcium carbonate ({CaTHAA}) biominerals. Although the fraction of biomineral bound to total amino acids in plankton was small, {\textless}1\%, the ratio of mineral-bound to non-mineral-bound amino acids increased with depth in the water column and sediments. Mineral-bound amino acids often dominated the total amino acid pool in biomineral-rich sediments beneath the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. {SiTHAA} were enriched in glycine and threonine relative to {THAA} and were similar in composition to {SiTHAA} in diatom frustules isolated from {APF} sediments. {CaTHAA} were enriched in aspartic acid relative to {THAA}. The difference in composition between mineral-bound amino acids and non-mineral-bound amino acids increased with depth. Amino acid composition has been used to develop a Degradation Index (sensu Dauwe and Middelburg, 1998). The unusual amino acid composition of Southern Ocean plankton, i.e., dominated by diatom cell walls, resulted in an apparent mismatch between the absolute value of the Degradation Index and the presumed extent of degradation. However, changes in amino acid composition that accompanied degradation were similar to those found in previous studies. Principal components analysis suggests that the greatest change in {THAA} composition occurred between the sediment surface floc layer and deeper sediments where particles had the longest residence time. Compositional changes observed in the water column suggested that degradation processes resulted in complete removal of amino acids, whereas changes in sediments were consistent both with selective degradation of plankton amino acids with depth and with the conversion of primarily phytoplankton biomass to that of bacterial biomass.},

	abstract = {Relationships between mineral specific surface area and organic carbon ({OC}) concentration are examined for sediments and soil A-horizons from throughout the world. I found (published elsewhere) that continental shelf sediments from many different regions exhibit downcore loss of {OC} to a refractory background level which shows a consistent relationship with mineral surface area (slope = 0.86 mg m−2 {OC}). This trend is equivalent to a monolayer of organic matter over all surfaces, and is termed the monolayer-equivalent ({ME}) level. Sediments and soils from other environments are compared to this empirically derived relationship. Several continental slope areas show extension of this relationship to considerable depth. Marked excesses of {OC} above this trend, which persist downcore, were found in sediments with high carbonate mineral content or slope sediments with low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the overlying water column. About half of the soils examined also adhered to this relationship, while soils with high carbonate content, low {pH}, or poor drainage showed {OC} concentrations higher than the {ME} level. {OC} concentrations below the {ME} level are found in deltaic regions and areas with low organic matter delivery such as the deep sea or arid soils. The nature of mineral surfaces was examined using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and most surface area was found to be present as pores with {\textless} 8-nm widths. A hypothesis is developed that explains the observed {OC} concentrations as a saturation of adsorption sites within small pores, which are small enough to exclude hydrolytic enzymes and hence protect organic matter against biological attack. The relationship between this hypothesis and other hypothesized protection mechanisms is discussed. Adsorption is shown to provide a mechanistic and quantitative explanation for spatial and temporal relationships between sedimentation rate and {OC} burial.},

	abstract = {{ORGANIC} matter preserved in marine sediments provides a molecular record of marine biological processes1, accounts for approximately 20\% of all carbon burial2 and plays a key role in balancing the long-term flux of oxygen to the atmosphere3. Only recently has it been appreciated that more than 90\% of the organic matter preserved in most marine sediments is intimately associated with mineral surfaces4. Little is known, however, of the effect that sorption to mineral surfaces might have in controlling either the lability or quantity of organic matter in the marine sedimentary record. The preserved organic material could be either intrinsically stable, or stabilized through interactions with mineral matrices. We show here that sorption of organic matter to mineral surfaces in marine sediments stabilizes the component molecules, slowing remineralization rates by up to five orders of magnitude. Sorptive protection can therefore account for the enigmatic preservation of intrinsically labile molecules such as amino acids and simple sugars in marine deposits5,6 and links the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments to the deposition of mineral surfaces.},

	abstract = {Sediment cores from six stations in the eastern North Sea were analyzed for protein amino acids, the nonprotein amino acids β-alanine and γ- aminobutyric acid and the hexosamines galactosamine and glucosamine, and bulk parameters (organic carbon, nitrogen, total hydrolyzable amino acids and carbohydrates) in order to establish the degradation state of sedimentary organic matter. The study sites were selected on the basis of their different physical settings and macrofaunal communities so that a broad quality range in the organic matter would likely be covered. To test if the molecular parameters provide a robust matrix for quality determination, we integrated our results with complementary literature data ranging from marine source organisms to deep-sea environments. A principal component analysis based on the mole percent contribution of amino acids show4 that there are systematic variations in the amino acid spectra as a consequence of degradation of organic matter. Comparison with more established quality parameters such as hexosamines confirmed that amino acids reflect the degradation state of the organic matter. The amino acids glycine, serine, and threonine were enriched in the more degraded material, and others, such as phenylalanine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucinc, became depleted with increasing degradation state. Selective preservation of structural compounds (diatom cell walls, chitinous organic matter) vs. preferential breakdown of cell plasma material appears to be the reason for the contrastin,; behavior of these molecular compounds. Some of the essential amino acids for macrofauna nutrition (arginine, methionine, and histidine) occurred in lower concentrations in the North Sea sediments compared to organism tissue and therefore may be limiting to growth of deposit-feeders.},
