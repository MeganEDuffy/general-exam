	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) in the oceans is one of the largest pools of reduced carbon on Earth, comparable in size to the atmospheric {CO}2 reservoir. A vast number of compounds are present in {DOM}, and they play important roles in all major element cycles, contribute to the storage of atmospheric {CO}2 in the ocean, support marine ecosystems, and facilitate interactions between organisms. At the heart of the {DOM} cycle lie molecular-level relationships between the individual compounds in {DOM} and the members of the ocean microbiome that produce and consume them. In the past, these connections have eluded clear definition because of the sheer numerical complexity of both {DOM} molecules and microorganisms. Emerging tools in analytical chemistry, microbiology, and informatics are breaking down the barriers to a fuller appreciation of these connections. Here we highlight questions being addressed using recent methodological and technological developments in those fields and consider how these advances are transforming our understanding of some of the most important reactions of the marine carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Amazon River runs nearly 6500 km across the South American continent before emptying into the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean. In terms of both volume and watershed area, it is the world's largest riverine system, affecting elemental cycling on a global scale.
{RESULTS}: A quantitative inventory of genes and transcripts benchmarked with internal standards was obtained at five stations in the lower Amazon River during May 2011. At each station, metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were obtained in duplicate for two microbial size fractions (free-living, 0.2 to 2.0 μm; particle-associated, 2.0 to 297 μm) using 150 × 150 paired-end Illumina sequencing. Forty eight sample datasets were obtained, averaging 15 × 10(6) potential protein-encoding reads each (730 × 10(6) total). Prokaryotic metagenomes and metatranscriptomes were dominated by members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Betaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospirae, and Acidobacteria. The actinobacterium {SCGC} {AAA}027-L06 reference genome recruited the greatest number of reads overall, with this single bin contributing an average of 50 billion genes and 500 million transcripts per liter of river water. Several dominant taxa were unevenly distributed between the free-living and particle-associated size fractions, such as a particle-associated bias for reads binning to planctomycete Schlesneria paludicola and a free-living bias for actinobacterium {SCGC} {AAA}027-L06. Gene expression ratios (transcripts to gene copy ratio) increased downstream from Óbidos to Macapá and Belém, indicating higher per cell activity of Amazon River bacteria and archaea as river water approached the ocean.
{CONCLUSION}: This inventory of riverine microbial genes and transcripts, benchmarked with internal standards for full quantitation, provides an unparalleled window into microbial taxa and functions in the globally important Amazon River ecosystem.},

Microbes in rivers perform essential ecosystem roles including the mineralization of significant quantities of organic matter originating from terrestrial habitats. The Amazon river in particular is famous for its size and importance in the mobilization of both water and carbon out of its enormous basin. Here we present the first metagenomic study on the microbiota of this river. It presents many features in common with the other freshwater metagenome available (Lake Gatun in Panama) and much less similarity with marine samples. Among the microbial taxa found, the cosmopolitan freshwater {acI} lineage of the actinobacteria was clearly dominant. Group I Crenarchaea and the freshwater sister group of the marine {SAR}11 clade, {LD}12, were found alongside more exclusive and well known freshwater taxa such as Polynucleobacter. A metabolism-centric analysis revealed a disproportionate representation of pathways involved in heterotrophic carbon processing, as compared to those found in marine samples. In particular, these river microbes appear to be specialized in taking up and mineralizing allochthonous carbon derived from plant material.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns in microbial biodiversity across the Amazon river-ocean continuum were investigated along ∼675 km of the lower Amazon River mainstem, in the Tapajós River tributary, and in the plume and coastal ocean during low and high river discharge using amplicon sequencing of 16S {rRNA} genes in whole water and size-fractionated samples (0.2-2.0 μm and {\textgreater}2.0 μm). River communities varied among tributaries, but mainstem communities were spatially homogeneous and tracked seasonal changes in river discharge and co-varying factors. Co-occurrence network analysis identified strongly interconnected river assemblages during high (May) and low (December) discharge periods, and weakly interconnected transitional assemblages in September, suggesting that this system supports two seasonal microbial communities linked to river discharge. In contrast, plume communities showed little seasonal differences and instead varied spatially tracking salinity. However, salinity explained only a small fraction of community variability, and plume communities in blooms of diatom-diazotroph assemblages were strikingly different than those in other high salinity plume samples. This suggests that while salinity physically structures plumes through buoyancy and mixing, the composition of plume-specific communities is controlled by other factors including nutrients, phytoplankton community composition, and dissolved organic matter chemistry. Co-occurrence networks identified interconnected assemblages associated with the highly productive low salinity near-shore region, diatom-diazotroph blooms, and the plume edge region, and weakly interconnected assemblages in high salinity regions. This suggests that the plume supports a transitional community influenced by immigration of ocean bacteria from the plume edge, and by species sorting as these communities adapt to local environmental conditions. Few studies have explored patterns of microbial diversity in tropical rivers and coastal oceans. Comparison of Amazon continuum microbial communities to those from temperate and arctic systems suggest that river discharge and salinity are master variables structuring a range of environmental conditions that control bacterial communities across the river-ocean continuum.},

	abstract = {Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth’s surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

	abstract = {What will control future rates of climate change? The carbon cycle is the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change, yet despite decades of research (1), significant mysteries about its behavior remain. Global analyses show that the Earth system absorbs approximately half of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. This uptake is partitioned between absorption by the oceans and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Uptake by the Earth system reduces the climate effects of emitted {CO}2 to approximately half of what would occur without sinks. Models tend to project sinks, particularly terrestrial sinks, into the future based on assumptions about the behavior of mechanisms derived from small plot or laboratory studies.

The observational record is now long enough and rich enough to provide strong constraints on both the human and the biogeochemical behavior of the carbon cycle. In this issue of {PNAS}, Canadell et al. (2) report an increase in the rate of increase in {CO}2 in the atmosphere (henceforth called the “growth rate”). They analyze the historical carbon record and industrial and biogeochemical causes to changes in its behavior over time. Industrial growth is responsible for ≈65\% of the change in the growth rate, 17\% is caused by increasing carbon intensity (fossil fuel use/gross world product), and 18\% is caused by reduced sinks in the Earth system. The reduction over time of the efficiency of the sinks is of great concern because it implies a weakening in the ability of the Earth system to mitigate the effects of fossil fuel emissions and a potential positive feedback that may strengthen in the future.

A progressive weakening of Earth system sinks has long been of concern (3), but until recently, insufficient information has existed to diagnose the behavior of the carbon sinks over time. The fraction of fossil fuel-derived {CO}2 remaining in …

	abstract = {The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2), the largest human contributor to human-induced climate change, is increasing rapidly. Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel {CO}2 emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000–2006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3\% to 3.3\% y−1. The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction ({AF}) of {CO}2 emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of {CO}2 sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric {CO}2 growth rate have been ≈65 ± 16\% from increasing global economic activity, 17 ± 6\% from the increasing carbon intensity of the global economy, and 18 ± 15\% from the increase in {AF}. An increasing {AF} is consistent with results of climate–carbon cycle models, but the magnitude of the observed signal appears larger than that estimated by models. All of these changes characterize a carbon cycle that is generating stronger-than-expected and sooner-than-expected climate forcing.},

Most potential controls on community composition also exhibited synchrony; these included bacterial production rate (leucine incorporation), water temperature, river flow rate, and a suite of chemical measurements. Temperature and river flow rate were the best predictors of temporal patterns in diversity. However, diversity patterns also correlated with bacterial production and concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate, suggesting that diversity is directly or indirectly influenced by complex seasonal shifts in environmental conditions. Winter and summer communities were somewhat predictable over 3 yr, although these communities were not identical. Two polymerase chain reaction ({PCR})-amplified clone libraries of 16S {rDNA}, constructed with summer samples from each river, were not significantly different and contained typical freshwater bacterioplankton of the beta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, including members of five new freshwater bacterioplankton clusters.

	abstract = {Recent advances in microbiology techniques, such as genetic sequencing, allow for rapid and cost-effective collection of large quantities of genetic information carried within water samples. Here we posit that the unique composition of aquatic {DNA} material within a water sample contains relevant information about hydrologic function at multiple temporal scales. In this study, machine learning was used to develop discharge prediction models trained on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa classified into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) based on 16S {rRNA} gene sequences from six large arctic rivers. We term this approach “genohydrology,” and show that {OTU} relative abundances can be used to predict river discharge at monthly and longer timescales. Based on a single {DNA} sample from each river, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}) for predicted mean monthly discharge values throughout the year was 0.84, while the {NSE} for predicted discharge values across different return intervals was 0.67. These are considerable improvements over predictions based only on the area-scaled mean specific discharge of five similar rivers, which had average {NSE} values of 0.64 and −0.32 for seasonal and recurrence interval discharge values, respectively. The genohydrology approach demonstrates that genetic diversity within the aquatic microbiome is a large and underutilized data resource with benefits for prediction of hydrologic function.},

But recent evidence suggests that Amazonian rivers outgas a significant amount of carbon dioxide. An extensive geochemical survey of rivers in the Amazon basin now finds that the dominant source of carbon dioxide is the respiration of organic matter that is less than five years old, probably originating from near-stream vegetation. Although most of the organic matter transported by these rivers is tens to thousands of years old, it is this small rapidly cycling pool of organic matter that is responsible for the large carbon dioxide fluxes from the rivers to the atmosphere in the humid tropics.},

The Amazon River exports large amounts of {DOM}, and yet the fate of this material in the ocean remains unclear. Here we investigate the molecular composition and transformations of {DOM} in the Amazon River-ocean continuum using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and geochemical and biological tracers. We show that there is a strong gradient in source and composition of {DOM} along the continuum, and that dilution of riverine {DOM} in the ocean is the dominant pattern of variability in the system. Alterations in {DOM} composition are observed in the plume associated with the addition of new organic compounds by phytoplankton and with bacterial and photochemical transformations. The relative importance of each of these drivers varies spatially and is modulated by seasonal variations in river discharge and ocean circulation. We further show that a large fraction (50–76\%) of the Amazon River {DOM} is surprisingly stable in the coastal ocean. This results in a globally significant river plume with a strong terrigenous signature and in substantial export of terrestrially derived organic carbon from the continental margin, where it can be entrained in the large-scale circulation and potentially contribute to the long-term storage of terrigenous production and to the recalcitrant carbon pool found in the deep ocean.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems in the humid tropics play a potentially important but presently ambiguous role in the global carbon cycle. Whereas global estimates of atmospheric {CO}2 exchange indicate that the tropics are near equilibrium or are a source with respect to carbon1,2, ground-based estimates indicate that the amount of carbon that is being absorbed by mature rainforests is similar to or greater than that being released by tropical deforestation3,4 (about 1.6 Gt C yr-1). Estimates of the magnitude of carbon sequestration are uncertain, however, depending on whether they are derived from measurements of gas fluxes above forests5,6 or of biomass accumulation in vegetation and soils3,7. It is also possible that methodological errors may overestimate rates of carbon uptake or that other loss processes have yet to be identified3. Here we demonstrate that outgassing (evasion) of {CO}2 from rivers and wetlands of the central Amazon basin constitutes an important carbon loss process, equal to 1.2 ± 0.3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. This carbon probably originates from organic matter transported from upland and flooded forests, which is then respired and outgassed downstream. Extrapolated across the entire basin, this flux—at 0.5 Gt C yr-1—is an order of magnitude greater than fluvial export of organic carbon to the ocean8. From these findings, we suggest that the overall carbon budget of rainforests, summed across terrestrial and aquatic environments, appears closer to being in balance than would be inferred from studies of uplands alone3,5,6.},

	abstract = {A large fraction of the organic carbon derived from land that is transported through inland waters is decomposed along river systems and emitted to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide ({CO}2). The Amazon River outgasses nearly as much {CO}2 as the rainforest sequesters on an annual basis, representing {\textasciitilde}25\% of global {CO}2 emissions from inland waters. However, current estimates of {CO}2 outgassing from the Amazon basin are based on a conservative upscaling of measurements made in the central Amazon, meaning both basin and global scale budgets are likely underestimated. The lower Amazon River, from Óbidos to the river mouth, represents {\textasciitilde}13\% of the total drainage basin area, and is not included in current basin-scale estimates. Here, we assessed the concentration and evasion rate of {CO}2 along the lower Amazon River corridor and its major tributaries, the Tapajós and Xingu Rivers. Evasive {CO}2 fluxes were directly measured using floating chambers and gas transfer coefficients (k600) were calculated for different hydrological seasons. Temporal variations in {pCO}2 and {CO}2 emissions were similar to previous observations throughout the Amazon (e.g. peak concentrations at high water) and {CO}2 outgassing was lower in the clearwater tributaries compared to the mainstem. However, k600 values were higher than previously reported upstream likely due to the generally windier conditions, turbulence caused by tidal forces, and an amplification of these factors in the wider channels with a longer fetch. We estimate that the lower Amazon River mainstem emits 0.2 Pg C yr-1 within our study boundaries, or as much as 0.48 Pg C yr-1 if the entire spatial extent to the geographical mouth is considered. Including these values with updated basin scale estimates and estimates of {CO}2 outgassing from small streams we estimate that the Amazon running waters outgasses as much as 1.39 Pg C yr-1, increasing the global emissions from inland waters by 43\% for a total of 2.9 Pg C yr-1. These results highlight a large missing gap in basin-scale carbon budgets along the complete continuum of the Amazon River, and likely most other large river systems, that could drastically alter global scale carbon budgets.},

Here, we explore the dynamics of dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) along the Amazon River-to-ocean continuum from the lower mainstem at Óbidos to the open ocean of the western tropical North Atlantic. We molecularly characterized {DOM} via ultrahigh-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ({FT}-{ICR}-{MS}), determined {DOM} stable carbon isotopes, and interpreted the data in the context of bacterial abundance and production, phytoplankton biomass and composition. Multivariate analysis revealed that the {DOM} molecular variability in the plume was mainly influenced by the input of terrigenous {DOM}. Incubation experiments with water from close to the river mouth showed that photo- and bio-degradation preferentially removed 13C-depleted and 13C-enriched terrigenous {DOM}, respectively. However, there was no significant quantitative change in the total amount of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) over five days. This result suggests that most of the reactive {DOM} had already been bio-degraded upstream within the river and that photo-degradation was diminished in the turbid plume close to the river mouth. Terrigenous {DOM} therefore appeared to be relatively non-reactive nearshore. In the less turbid offshore plume, enhanced light penetration stimulated growth of phytoplankton and increased bacterial production. Although marine {DOM} compounds became relatively enriched, bulk {DOC} concentrations were 9 to 30\% below levels expected from conservative mixing of river and ocean endmembers suggesting that quantitative removal of terrigenous {DOM} was not compensated by marine {DOM} production. We propose that removal of terrigenous {DOM} in the outer plume may be enhanced by (i) bio-degradation primed by reactive algal {DOM}, (ii) photo-degradation, which may further break down {DOM} into more bio-available forms, and possibly (iii) sorption of {DOM} to sinking particles.},

Three mainstem stations spanning a 625 km reach had similar gene expression patterns (transcripts gene copy-1) across a diverse suite of element cycling genes, but two tributary-influenced stations at the mouth of the Tapajós River and near the Tocantins River at Belém had distinct transcriptome composition and expression ratios, particularly for genes encoding light-related energy capture (higher) and iron acquisition and ammonia oxidation (lower). Environmental parameters that were useful predictors of gene expression ratios included concentrations of lignin phenols, suspended sediments, nitrate, phosphate, and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen. Similar to the gene expression data, these chemical properties reflected highly homogeneous mainstem stations punctuated by distinct tributary-influenced stations at Tapajós and Belém. Although heterotrophic processes were expected to dominate in the lower Amazon, transcripts from photosynthetic bacteria were abundant in tributary-influenced regions, and transcripts from Thaumarcheota taxa genetically capable of chemosynthetic ammonia oxidation accounted for up to 21\% of the transcriptome at others. Based on regressions of transcript numbers against gene numbers, expression ratios of Thaumarchaeota populations were largely unchanged within the mainstem, suggesting a relatively minor role for gene regulation. These quantitative gene and transcript inventories detail a diverse array of energy acquisition strategies and metabolic capabilities for bacteria and archaea populations of the world’s largest river system.},

	abstract = {The Amazon River watershed and its associated plume comprise a vast continental and oceanic area. The microbial activities along this continuum contribute substantially to global carbon and nutrient cycling, and yet there is a dearth of information on the diversity, abundance, and possible roles of viruses in this globally important river. The aim of this study was to elucidate the diversity and structure of virus assemblages of the Amazon River-ocean continuum. Environmental viral {DNA} sequences were obtained for 12 locations along the river’s lower reach (n = 5) and plume (n = 7). Sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes. Despite the spatial connectivity mediated by the river, virome analyses and physical-chemical water parameters clearly distinguished river and plume ecosystems. Bacteriophages were ubiquitous in the continuum and were more abundant in the transition region. Eukaryotic viruses occurred mostly in the river, while the plume had more viruses of autotrophic organisms (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) and heterotrophic bacteria (Pelagibacter). The viral families Microviridae and Myoviridae were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. The major functions of the genes in the continuum involved viral structures and life cycles, and viruses from plume locations and Tapajós River showed the highest levels of functional diversity. The distribution patterns of the viral assemblages were defined not only by the occurrence of possible hosts but also by water physical and chemical parameters, especially salinity. The findings presented here help to improve understanding of the possible roles of viruses in the organic matter cycle along the river-ocean continuum.
{IMPORTANCE} The Amazon River forms a vast plume in the Atlantic Ocean that can extend for more than 1,000 km. Microbial communities promote a globally relevant carbon sink system in the plume. Despite the importance of viruses for the global carbon cycle, the diversity and the possible roles of viruses in the Amazon are poorly understood. The present work assesses, for the first time, the abundance and diversity of viruses simultaneously in the river and ocean in order to elucidate their possible roles. {DNA} sequence assembly yielded 29,358 scaffolds, encoding 82,546 viral proteins, with 15 new complete viral genomes from the 12 river and ocean locations. Viral diversity was clearly distinguished by river and ocean. Bacteriophages were the most abundant and occurred throughout the continuum. Viruses that infect eukaryotes were more abundant in the river, whereas phages appeared to have strong control over the host prokaryotic populations in the plume.},

Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the connectivity of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine carbon budgets due to a lack of measurements along the lower (i.e. tidally-influenced) reaches of large river systems. For example, all estimates of carbon fluxes from the world's largest river, the Amazon, are based on measurements made at and upstream of Óbidos, roughly 900km from the mouth. Here we examine the evolution of {OC} concentrations and composition from Óbidos to two discreet channels near the mouth of the Amazon River during five cruises from 2010 to 2012. {OC} characteristics of the Tapajós River, which enters the Amazon River downstream of Óbidos, and the Tocantins River, which mixes with the Amazon River plume in the Atlantic Ocean, were also assessed. The average concentration of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) across the two main channels near the mouth was 0.6±0.3mgL−1 during the study period, decreasing from 1.2±1.0mgL−1 at Óbidos. Average dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) concentrations, on the other hand, increased from 3.9±0.6mgL−1 at Óbidos to 4.2±0.9mgL−1 across the mouth. The discharge of total {OC} to the ocean was composed of 89±3\% dissolved load, compared to 76±13\% at Óbidos. Measurements of bulk {OC} stable isotopic signatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and lignin phenol abundance were used to assess unique {OC} sources along the continuum. For example, the stable isotopic composition of {POC} and {DOC} indicated a replacement of highland forest-derived {OC} with lowland and floodplain-derived {OC} from Óbidos to the mouth. Likewise, lignin phenol signatures showed an increase in the degradation state of vascular plant-derived {OC} from Óbidos to the mouth. Results from this study illustrate that the abundance and composition of {OC} continue to evolve along the lower reaches of large tropical rivers, which has significant implications on estimations of geochemical fluxes to the ocean.},

	abstract = {Here we present direct measurements of the biological breakdown of 13C-labeled substrates to {CO}2 at seven locations along the lower Amazon River, from Óbidos to the mouth. Dark incubation experiments were performed at high and low water periods using vanillin, a lignin phenol derived from vascular plants, and at the high water period using four different 13C-labeled plant litter leachates. Leachates derived from oak wood were degraded most slowly with vanillin monomers, macrophyte leaves, macrophyte stems, and whole grass leachates being converted to {CO}2 1.2, 1.3, 1.7, and 2.3 times faster, respectively, at the upstream boundary, Óbidos. Relative to Óbidos, the sum degradation rate of all four leachates was 3.3 and 2.6 times faster in the algae-rich Tapajós and Xingu Rivers, respectively. Likewise, the leachates were broken down 3.2 times more quickly at Óbidos when algal biomass from the Tapajós River was simultaneously added. Leachate reactivity similarly increased from Óbidos to the mouth with leachates breaking down 1.7 times more quickly at Almeirim (midway to the mouth) and 2.8 times more quickly across the river mouth. There was no discernible correlation between in situ nutrient levels and remineralization rates, suggesting that priming effects were an important factor controlling reactivity along the continuum. Further, continuous measurements of {CO}2, O2, and conductivity along the confluence of the Tapajós and Amazon Rivers and the Xingu and Jarauçu Rivers revealed in situ evidence for enhanced O2 drawdown and {CO}2 production along the mixing zone of these confluences.},

	abstract = {Here, we examine how marine microbial communities respond when dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) is mobilized from coastal wetlands. Biological transformations of this {DOM} may increase in the presence of reactive substrates, such as algal‐derived {DOM} ({ADOM}) in the coastal zone—a process known as priming. We performed laboratory experiments examining transformations of {DOM} derived from coastal wetland peat ({PDOM}) with and without the presence {ADOM}. Associated shifts in microbial community composition and functional gene abundance were measured to evaluate mechanisms of priming effects. {ADOM} presence stimulated {CO}2 production when compared to the seawater control, which was further enhanced in the copresence of {PDOM}. {DOM} characterization showed a substantial difference in features present at the end of the incubation when {PDOM} was present with and without {ADOM}, while metagenomic sequencing indicated shifts in microbial community composition and identified 23 unique functional genes associated with pathways for the breakdown of aromatic compounds.},
