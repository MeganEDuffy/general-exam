	abstract = {Vertical fluxes of bulk particulate material, organic carbon, nitrogen, lignin-derived phenols, and neutral sugars through the water column and into surface sediments of Dabob Bay, Washington, were determined monthly for 1 yr by sediment trap deployments at 30, 60, and 90 m at a site 110 m deep. Vertical fluxes of sinking bulk particulate material in this marine bay were elevated during winter and increased in consistent proportion to sediment trap deployment depth throughout the year. Although annual average particle fluxes at 30 and 60 m bracketed the mean accumulation rate of the underlying sediment, the flux at 90 m was higher by a factor of 2 due to resuspension, horizontal advection, or both. The monthly fluxes of lignin-derived phenols paralleled those of total particulate material, indicating a common riverine origin. The annual average fluxes of vanillyl and cinnamyl phenols through the water column closely matched the corresponding accumulation rates in the underlying sediment, whereas about a third of the total syringyl phenol input was degraded at the water- sediment interface. Although p-hydroxyacetophenone exhibited a stability typical of lignin-derived phenols, the distinctly higher reactivities ({\textgreater} 60\% degradation) of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and p-hydroxybenzoic acid indicate a predominantly nonlignin source. On average, 60 and 70\%, respectively, of the total particulate organic carbon and nitrogen and 65–75\% of all neutral sugars settling through the midwater column were degraded at the water- sediment interface. The elemental and carbohydrate composition of the degraded material was similar to that of local net plankton except for higher percentages of glucose and total neutral sugars. Land-derived organic material accounted for about one-third of the total organic carbon passing through the midwater column and two-thirds of the organic carbon accumulating in the underlying sediments. The amounts of plankton-derived organic matter sinking through the midwater column and being preserved in the sediments below corresponded to 14 and 3\% of the annual mean primary productivity. Plankton-derived organic matter exhibited about 5 times the reactivity of local land-derived organic matter at the water-sediment interface of Dabob Bay and supported essentially all of the benthic respiration.},

	abstract = {The vascular land plant biopolymers lignin and cutin were surveyed in the surface sediments of coastal and open ocean waters by controlled alkaline {CuO} oxidation/reaction. Two contrasting oceanic regimes were studied: the northwest Mediterranean ({NWM}) Sea, which receives significant particulate terrigenous debris through riverine discharge; and the northeast Atlantic ({NEA}) Ocean, with poorly characterised terrestrial carbon inputs. In the {NWM} products of lignin and cutin co-occurred at all stations, elevated levels (ca. 0.5–3.0 mg lignin phenols/100 mg organic carbon; ca. 0.01–0.09 mg cutin acids/100 mg organic carbon) were observed for near-shore deltaic and shelf sediments. The influence of terrestrial land plant inputs extended across the shelf and through the slope to the abyssal plain, providing molecular evidence for advective offshore transfer of terrestrial carbon. Mass balance estimates for the basin suggest riverine inputs account for the majority of surface sedimentary lignin/cutin, most of which ({\textgreater}90\%) is deposited on the shelf. Products of {CuO} oxidation of lignin and cutin were also detected in {NEA} surface sediments, at levels comparable to those observed for the {NWM} continental slope, and were detectable at low concentrations (ca. 0.5 μgg−1 in the sediments of the abyssal plains ({\textgreater}4,000 m depth). While atmospheric deposition of lignin/cutin-derived material cannot be discounted in this open ocean system, lateral advective transfer of enriched shelf sediments is inferred as a possible transport process. A progressive enrichment in cutin-derived material relative to lignin was observed offshore, with evidence of an increase in the degree of oxidative alteration of lignin residues. To account for these observations, preferential offshore transport of finer and more degraded material is proposed. Nonspecific oxidation products dominated the gas chromatograms of {NEA} sediments, which appear to originate from marine sources of sedimentary organic carbon. Preliminary mass balance calculations applied to the global ocean margin suggest riverine sources of both particulate lignin and cutin are important and that most ({\textgreater}95\%) deposition of recognisable land plant biopolymers occurs in shelf seas.},

	abstract = {Terrigenous dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) is continuously discharged by rivers into the ocean, yet its distribution and reactivity within ocean basins remain poorly defined aspects of the global carbon cycle1. Direct evidence for the presence of terrigenous {DOM} in the open ocean has been found only in dissolved humic substances isolated from surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean2. Here we report the detection of low concentrations of lignin—a biopolymer found only in terrestrial vegetation—in {DOM} collected from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating that terrigenous {DOM} is distributed throughout the ocean water column. Higher lignin concentrations in Atlantic waters, relative to Pacific waters, reflect terrigenous {DOM} concentrations that are 2.6 times higher in the Atlantic. This finding is consistent with the 3.6-times greater riverine water-discharge to the Atlantic Ocean3,4, and with known patterns of ocean circulation5. It appears that terrigenous {DOM} comprises only a small fraction (0.7–2.4\%) of the total {DOM} in the ocean, and that its oceanic residence time (21–132yr) is much shorter than that of marine {DOM}6,7. The regeneration of nutrients during rapid cycling of terrigenous {DOM} could contribute to high rates of primary production in the coastal ocean.},
