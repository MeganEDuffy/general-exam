	abstract = {Arctic waters are often enriched with terrestrial dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) characterized by having elevated visible wavelength fluorescence (commonly termed humic-like). Here, we have identified the sources of fluorescent {DOM} ({FDOM}) in a high Arctic fjord (Young Sound, {NE} Greenland) influenced by glacial meltwater. The biological transformation of {FDOM} was further investigated using plankton community size-fractionation experiments. The intensity of ultraviolet fluorescence (commonly termed amino acid-like) was highly variable and positively correlated to bacterial production and mesozooplankton grazing. The overall distribution of visible {FDOM} in the fjord was hydrographically driven by the high-signal intrusion of Arctic terrestrial {DOM} from shelf waters and dilution with glacial runoff in the surface waters. However, the high-intensity visible {FDOM} that accumulated in subsurface waters in summer was not solely linked to allochthonous sources. Our data indicate that microbial activity, in particular, protist bacterivory, to be a source. A decrease in visible {FDOM} in subsurface waters was concurrent with an increase in bacterial abundance, indicating an active bacterial uptake or modification of this {DOM} fraction. This was confirmed by net-loss of visible {FDOM} in experiments during summer when bacterial activity was high. The degradation of visible {FDOM} appeared to be associated with bacteria belonging to the order Alteromonadales mainly the genus Glaciecola and the {SAR}92 clade. The findings provide new insight into the character of Arctic terrestrial {DOM} and the biological production and degradation of both visible and {UV} wavelength organic matter in the coastal Arctic.},
